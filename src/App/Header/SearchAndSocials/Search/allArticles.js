        article: `States are preparing a detailed report on this case. US President Donald Trump said the full report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Hashoggi will be published on November 20. The words of Trump were transmitted by journalists from the White House press pool, who accompanied him during his trip to California, where fires broke out. Trump emphasized that the report will identify those who killed the journalist. "There was a terrible thing - the murder of a journalist. We will have a full report within the next two days, possibly on Monday or Tuesday, "the head of state said. Later, the US president clarified that it was going to be on Tuesday. Trump also confirmed that he had a telephone conversation with Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Gina Hespel on Saturday on his aircraft. He added that the information that appeared on the CIA on Friday in the media was "preliminary". "They (CIA) have not yet determined anything. It's too early, "he explained. As it was reported, 59-year-old Hashoggi was killed on October 2 at the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, when he went there to pick up the documents required for the future wedding. His bride was not allowed to enter the institution and after five hours of waiting she was informed that Hashoggi had already left the consulate. The journalist had long ties to the royal family of Saudi Arabia, but he critically wrote about the current government and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In Turkey, they suspect that her husband was questioned, tortured, and then killed and dismembered. For this purpose, 15 officers of the Saudi security services flew to Istanbul on that day. The investigation has sound recordings. After several weeks of objections and under heavy pressure from the West, the Saudi authorities still admitted that the journalist was killed in their consulate. Subsequently, the Turkish authorities reported that, a few days after the assassination of Hashoggi, Saudi Arabia sent a group of 11 experts to Turkey, including a chemist and a toxicologist who had to "cover the traces" of the crime.`,

        Whenever I was in my room alone, that was when I would call home to speak to my children, as when I was with Robert, he didn't want us to have our phones and have contact with the outside world.
        When I met Robert, or rather R. Kelly, it wasn't like meeting Prince Charming who swept me off my feet. He didn't wine and dine me, he was just a warm and funny guy. We did normal stuff; he took me shopping and we enjoyed having dinners together.
        But there was a moment during a text exchange in 2014 when I think I should have known things weren't what they seemed. It was really early on in our relationship and I texted him, addressing him as Rob and he said: "No, can you just call me Daddy." There was no discussion - he just told me his demand. When I look back at that moment, reading the text message in my car, I should have questioned it. I should have seen his behaviour in that moment as a red flag.
        I was first introduced to R. Kelly in September 2013 by a member of his entourage, when he was performing in a club in Atlanta to promote his next tour. However, we had a proper introduction in January 2014.`,

So is it the best place for her? At this point, she's not sure.
        Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world. Cambridge is the fourth-oldest surviving university in the world. Cambridge has produced, so far, 90 Nobel prize winners - and Cambridge, this educational powerhouse, just might not be where I want to go. At least, that's how I feel right now, a week after finding out that I got a place.  
        Anoushka's applications provoked some fiery discussions at home
        It was my parents who first encouraged me to try for Cambridge. They see it as a passport to the best jobs and opportunities. But I worry about what life would be like in a university which still admits quite a high proportion of pupils from private schools, and where I would be one of only a handful in my year from a mixed white/Black African family - in 2017 there were just 14. There's no escaping the fact that Cambridge is a majority white and majority posh (!) institution.
        My mum, Anjula, is Ugandan and fled from Idi Amin's tyrannical regime in the 1970s. The story of people like her with a mixed Indian and Ugandan background is largely overlooked from accounts of racial tension in Uganda, and there's little understanding of the struggles she and others faced once they arrived in the UK. The experience of minority communities has helped shape my interest in unwritten histories (you try explaining this in a UCAS statement with a limit of 4,000 characters) so it stands to reason that I would focus on racial diversity in the universities I'm considering.
        In the mix are Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge and King's College, London.`,

        article: `Just over a year ago, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul. The Intercontinental was popular with foreign visitors - which is why, on 20 January, Taliban gunmen stormed it, killing at least 40 people. Vasileios explains how he survived.
        I had decided to go for dinner early - at six o'clock - with my friend, another pilot called Michael Poulikakos. It was the first time in the three or four months that I had been coming to the Intercontinental that I'd done this - usually I had dinner at around 8.30pm.
        We finished dinner about 7.30pm and then I went up to my room - room 522 - on the top floor, to make some calls. At 8.47pm I was on the phone to Athens when I heard a big explosion down in the lobby.
        I went out on to the balcony. I could see a man on the ground covered in blood and I could hear gunfire coming from inside and outside the hotel. I realised how lucky it was that I wasn't in the restaurant at that moment and said to myself, "OK Vasileios, you have to do something in order to survive."
        I left the balcony door open and locked the door to my room. There were two beds in my suite so I took one of the mattresses and put it against the door to protect myself from grenades, and then I gathered some bed sheets, towels and clothes and made a rope that I could use to get to the fourth floor if I needed to.
        Because I'm a pilot and a trainer I've studied crisis management and decision-making for years, so even if I'm only going to a restaurant or to the theatre I think about sitting by the door, or close to the emergency exit - it's automatic, almost second nature.
        I started thinking about what I was going to do next. I had no idea how many attackers there were or where they were in the building, and jumping from the fifth floor wasn't wise, so I said to myself, "Vasileios, stay inside and try to do as much as possible to protect yourself."
        For some reason I can't really explain, I was unexpectedly calm.`,

        At a halfway house in Hiroshima - for criminals who are being released from jail back into the community - 69-year-old Toshio Takata tells me he broke the law because he was poor. He wanted somewhere to live free of charge, even if it was behind bars.
        "I reached pension age and then I ran out of money. So it occurred to me - perhaps I could live for free if I lived in jail," he says. 
        "So I took a bicycle and rode it to the police station and told the guy there: 'Look, I took this.'" 
        The plan worked. This was Toshio's first offence, committed when he was 62, but Japanese courts treat petty theft seriously, so it was enough to get him a one-year sentence.
        Small, slender, and with a tendency to giggle, Toshio looks nothing like a habitual criminal, much less someone who'd threaten women with knives. But after he was released from his first sentence, that's exactly what he did.
        "I went to a park and just threatened them. I wasn't intending to do any harm. I just showed the knife to them hoping one of them would call the police. One did."`,

        Russian soldier Cyril Sidelnikov was knocked out by an Israeli rival, Adam Keresh, at the MMA Bellator 209.
        Keresh used haykik (kicking his head, note), thus sending one of the best heavyweights in deep knockout.
        After this result, Keresh has two victories and no defeats. As for Sidelnikov, he has already suffered a fifth failure.`,

        Researchers found that pneumonia could be the cause of the death of 10.8 million children over the next 12 years.
        This is reported by The Telegraph.
        The research was conducted by specialists from Save the Children International and Johns Hopkins University.
        Pneumonia kills more children under the age of five than infectious diseases such as measles, malaria and diarrhea. The last kills nearly one million children each year.
        The disease affects the lungs that are inflamed and filled with fluid. This is due to an infection from bacteria, viruses or parasites, in developed countries mainly affects the elderly.`,

        article: `It’s the year 2140 and two kids ride their skimboards in the heart of Manhattan, near the point where Sixth Avenue meets Broadway. If you are familiar with this junction you would know it is far from the US’ current coastline. But in Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel New York 2140, Manhattan is flooded after unabated climate change causes the sea level to rise by 50ft (15.25m). The amphibian city is now a SuperVenice, a grid of canals populated by vaporettos where characters must learn how to deal with a world both familiar and unrecognisable to us. Mid-Manhattan skimboading is all too possible in this future.
        Robinson’s 2017 climate-fiction novel belongs to a growing cadre of works about drowned nations, wind farm utopias or scarred metropolises decades into the future. As diplomats draft the rulebook for the global response to the climate crisis and engineers race to produce better solar panels, writers have found their role, too: telling what Robinson calls “the story of the next century”. In doing that, they might be helping readers across the world comprehend the situation in which we currently find ourselves.  
        Climate change is a notoriously elusive crisis to make sense of, particularly compared to other human-impact catastrophes. Drop some toxic chemicals in a river now and you will see dead fish within days, but what do you witness when you release carbon dioxide? And while, in 2018, a report by UN climate scientists stated that we are heading towards a catastrophe, who can truly imagine what that looks like?
        This is where fiction comes in: it brings the abstract data closer to home by focusing on the faces and stories in these futures. Show readers a detailed and textured account of a climate-changed future, says Robinson, and they have an easier time imagining it. It feels real: characters in these novels worry about the welfare of their children, meddle in extra-marital affairs and grapple with train schedules, just as readers would on their daily lives.
        Abstract futures
        “Science fiction gets people thinking in a way that another report on climate change doesn’t,” says Shelley Streeby, a Professor of Literature and Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego. “It helps people feel about what might be coming, but also about the present.”
        The numbers for climate fiction, or cli-fi as some people call it, are hard to pinpoint – but they are growing fast. A 2016 review tallied 50 novels dealing specifically with man-made climate change and its effects, with 20 appearing in the previous five years, although this number includes all types of novels. That includes John Lanchester’s new environmental fable, The Wall, which has been described as “disquieting and quite good fun at the same time”.`,

        From 1976 until his death in 2013, Georg P Salzmann collected about 12,000 books that had been banned – and burnt – by the Nazis for being ‘un-German’. His father – a Nazi – had shot himself in 1945, when Georg was a teenager.

        article: `From the Gashlycrumb Tinies to The Doubtful Guest, Edward Gorey’s morbidly funny little books are gothic surrealist masterpieces. Drawing on sources as varied as the novels of Agatha Christie and French silent film, he created a uniquely macabre vision of the world filled with crumbling English mansions, jittery dark-eyed flappers and stony faced Edwardian gents where nothing is quite as it seems. His virtuosic illustrations and poetic texts have drawn comparisons to Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear and Samuel Beckett, winning him critical acclaim and a devoted cult following in his native US. Lemony Snicket. Gorey himself was a complicated, reclusive individual whose mission in life was “to make everybody as uneasy as possible”. He collected daguerreotypes of dead babies and lived alone with 20,000 books and six cats in his New York apartment. Sporting an Edwardian beard, he would frequently traipse around the city in a full-length fur coat accessorised with trainers and jangling bracelets.
        A precociously gifted child, he grew up in depression-era Chicago, learning to draw at the age of one-and-a-half and teaching himself to read at three. He had devoured Dracula by the age of five and the complete works of Victor Hugo before he was eight, absorbing a gothic sensibility which would later imprint itself on his work.
        A mystery wrapped in an enigma
        The country house murder mysteries of favourites such as Christie and Dorothy L Sayers nurtured his Anglophilia – although he never actually visited England. Friends believe his fantasy could never have coped with the reality. Regular trips to the theatre, ballet and concerts were instrumental in turning him into a cultural omnivore, a tendency which expanded even further once he entered Harvard after World War Two.
        Here his social circle revolved around what Mark Dery, author of Gorey’s first major biography Born to be Posthumous, refers to as the “gay literati”, including the poet Frank O’Hara with whom he shared a passion for obscure literature. Although most people who met him assumed Gorey was also gay, he was notoriously reticent on the subject. When one interviewer pressed him on his sex life, “he responded: ‘I’m a person first, an artist a distant second and whatever else last,’” says Dery.
        There is certainly an undercurrent of homoeroticism, gender fluidity and same-sex couplings running throughout Gorey’s oeuvre and he noted in a letter to a friend that ‘les boys’, as he phrased it, appeared to be among the first to appreciate his unusual works.
        Gorey’s unique style first came to public notice as a designer of paperback covers for Doubleday’s Anchor Books imprint. His elegantly elongated figures and sombre palette, inspired both by the English illustrator Edward Ardizzone and the Japanese Ukiyo-e prints he loved, were in marked contrast to the pulp fiction-inspired covers prevalent at the time.
        The Anchor job meant a move to New York, which did not enthuse him, but opened up a whole new world of cultural possibilities. At the silent film evenings run by the film historian William K Everson, he discovered the work of French film-maker Louis Feuillade. His gothic-macabre crime thrillers Fantômas and Les Vampires would become “the greatest influence on my work. Period,” Gorey later said. The potted palms, pattern-on-pattern decor in interior sets and mysteriously veiled women in dark clothes who populated his films would become instantly recognisable Gorey motifs.`,

        article: `A new novel imagines the life of Frieda von Richthofen, the inspiration for many of DH Lawrence’s female characters. Hephzibah Anderson looks at the fate of the literary muse. As job descriptions go, few seem to fit the ‘nice work if you can get it’ category more snugly than ‘muse’. Inspiring lasting works of art by simply existing? It’s at once indolent and noble, evocative of days spent lounging on a chaise longue and nights filled with dance and glittering conversation.
        A look at the life of Frieda von Richthofen might leave you feeling rather differently. She was the inspiration – and model – for many of DH Lawrence’s female characters, including his most scandalous, Lady Chatterley. Yet muse, as she lived it, was a far from undemanding role, encompassing everything from lover and confidante to punch bag. At least, that’s the way Annabel Abbs tells it in a new novel based on her life, titled simply Frieda.
        The daughter of a penniless German baron with a roving eye, Frieda craves adventure and intellectual stimulation. Marriage is all that’s available to her and so, in 1899, aged just 20, she weds British philologist Ernest Weekley. They make their home in Nottingham, back then a heavily industrial town whose factories are a chorus of “clanging and clacking, hissing and spitting”, and in whose air particles of soot hover “like swarms of aphids”.
        In Abbs' novel, Weekley turns out to be the kind of chap who’s far happier thinking about his “snowflower” in absentia, as an ideal, than having to engage with the desires and frustrations of a real woman. While he toils over his seminal book, she has three children, the eldest of whom is seven when she begins to feel something stirring within her. She calls it “the what-I-could-be”.
        Her fickle sister suggests a tonic: infidelity. And as history shows, it was through Else von Richthofen that Frieda met maverick psychoanalyst Otto Gross, who did indeed become her lover, though the affair doesn't cure her of her restlessness. Then Mr Lawrence comes to lunch. A scrawny, gifted miner’s son six years her junior, he’s her husband’s former student. It takes just a single charged conversation for their passion to ignite.`,

Because you’re holding a little frozen moment of their life – they may have spent… a long time if it’s a manuscript with that piece of paper, they touched it.”
        Pedro Corrêa do Lago has one of the largest private collections of autographed letters and manuscripts in the world. It includes tens of thousands of handwritten documents from 5000 of the most important figures in the fields of art, literature, history, science, music and entertainment since 1153. They have just been brought together in a new book, The Magic of Handwriting.
        There’s a marble order sketched by Michelangelo; Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s first and last known letters; Sigmund Freud’s bill for 20 sessions; a letter from Emily Dickinson; Puccini’s score for Girl of the Golden West; drafts for In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust; a sketch of the Tramp’s accessories by Charlie Chaplin; and a letter from Mary Shelley a few months after the death of her husband Percy Shelley, asking Italian authorities to hand over the boat in which he drowned and all its contents. There’s also a letter from Wolfgang Mozart to his father Leopold, mentioning that he’s been dating a young singer – something that might have troubled Leopold, who wanted his son to focus instead on his studies.
        Corrêa do Lago tells BBC Culture what it’s like to hold a piece of handwritten history in his hands. “It’s the moment of creation that is materialised in that piece of paper.”`,

        Work on the 1,225km (760-mile) Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea is already well under way and is set to be finished by the end of 2019.
        The EU wants to bring pipelines coming into the bloc under its energy rules.
        Germany feared that would make the pipeline uneconomic and unviable.
        In the end 27 of the bloc's 28 ambassadors reportedly agreed with a Franco-German compromise, which meant that Germany could remain as lead negotiator on the Nord Stream 2 project.
        What are the worries with Nord Stream 2?
        Russia currently supplies around 40% of the EU's gas supplies, just ahead of Norway, which is not in the EU but takes part in the bloc's single market.
        For years, the 28-member bloc has been concerned about reliance on Russian gas.`,

        But reports about banks such as Morgan Stanley, Barclays and Bank of America moving, or creating, hundreds rather than thousands of jobs at those sites suggest the total affected in the City is much smaller than the 65,000 or so predicted by some immediately after the referendum.`,

        article: `Clash of the Titans was one of the most popular films of 1981. Its glittering retinue of Hollywood stars told the story of Perseus, the demigod from Greek mythology who kills a sea monster and saves the beautiful princess Andromeda from being said monster’s lunch. Such was the film’s popularity that it was remade in 2010; the film managed a rather disparaging 26% on the Rotten Tomatoes site. How many of those rating the film had a classical education is unclear, but perhaps it would have performed better had its producers done their research. As according to British art historian Elizabeth McGrath’s 1992 article The Black Andromeda, Andromeda was, indeed, originally depicted as a black princess from Ethiopia.
        Anyone who watched either of the two Clash of the Titans films will know that Judi Bowker and Alexa Devalos are both white women, and anyone who has seen Andromeda in a painting – perhaps Titian’s or Poynter’s – will believe she is white too. But McGrath’s article was definitive in addressing three things: that all the Greek mythographers placed Andromeda as a princess of Ethiopia, that Ovid specifically refers to her dark skin and that artists throughout Western art history frequently omitted to depict her blackness because Andromeda was supposed to be beautiful, and blackness and beauty – for many of them – was dichotomous. There is no doubt about Andromena’s race, according to Professor McGrath.
        Yet Renaissance art repeatedly depicts Andromeda as white. In Piero di Cosimo’s Perseus Freeing Andromeda from the 1510s she is actually whiter than all the figures around her, including a black musician and her parents, who are considerably darker and in exotic costume. We do know that there was active debate about her skin colour, a debate that would certainly seem racist to modern eyes. McGrath references Francisco Pacheco, a Spanish artist and writer, who asks in one passage of his book Arte de la Pintura why Andromeda is so often painted as white-skinned when several of the sources say she is black. `,

This small issue escalates quickly, as conflicts often do around Rita. The other school’s headmaster has taken her mug, seemingly on purpose, and is unapologetic. Distinctive with her long hair, leather jacket and endless selection of plaid shirts, Rita confronts him. He knows who she is, by reputation. “A rebel like you shouldn’t care,” he says. He brags about having read her staff file. “Eleven warnings in one year,” he says. “Suspended for sleeping with a pupil’s father.”
        “I must be good, only getting a warning,” she returns.
        “Or else you’re sleeping with Rasmus,” he says, referring to her school’s headmaster.
        This is a scene from the second-season premiere of the Danish hit dramatic-comedy series Rita, and it sums the show up nicely: Rita is a teacher. Rita is unconventional. Rita is unapologetic about sexuality, if a bit lacking in discernment. Rita is, in fact, sleeping with Rasmus.

        article: `The US critic Jed Perl once referred to Bonnard as “the most idiosyncratic of all the great 20th-Century painters”. His highly original compositions repeatedly focus on favoured motifs – a dining-room table, the view from a window or his lifelong partner Marthe De Méligny stretched out in a bath. They rely less on traditional modes of pictorial structure than a voluptuous use of colour that comes not from nature but his own interior logic.
        Vibrant shades of viridian green miraculously exist in harmony with the bright blues and oranges of a landscape, while elsewhere shades of mauve, gold and blue ripple across the walls of a bathroom. The resulting compositions combine psychological insight with an often sublime poetic sensibility.
        The deceptive joyfulness of his works combined with the difficulty of identifying him with any one artistic movement has sometimes led to the ground-breaking nature of his work being overlooked. A new exhibition at London’s Tate Modern hopes to show that his continuous and radical experiments with colour and form, which sometimes took him to the brink of abstraction, in fact make him one of the most innovative and unique painters of the 19th and 20th Centuries.`,

        article: `In 1911, William deMille made the most boneheaded prediction in the history of acting. A theatre kid he’d known was quitting the stage for the moving-picture screen. “She can’t be more than 17,” he tut-tutted in a letter, “and now she’s throwing her whole career in the ashcan and burying herself in a cheap form of amusement. There will never be any real money in those galloping tintypes.” The theatre was 2,500 years old, and this girl was risking her future on a fad. “Say goodbye to little Mary Pickford. She’ll never be heard of again.”
        Four years later, Mary Pickford was the most famous woman in the world; the first female celebrity not just known by name, reputation or sketch, but even the way the corners of her eyes curled down when she smiled. Everyone who’d seen her in Tess of the Storm Country (1914) or Rags (1915) knew exactly how she looked – long ringlets, childish dresses, the image of innocence – and they froze her like that forever. The curls cost $50 each, a fortune when a movie ticket was just over a nickel, and Pickford travelled with a suitcase of them.
        The hair belonged to her, but she belonged to everyone. Strangers stole the flowers from her hat and got upset if she ran around barefoot on film. When a child spotted America’s Sweetheart with a manicure – ”Mama! She’s not a real little girl! She has long fingernails!” – Pickford clipped them short and banned herself from fiddling with lipsticks and pencils in public in case someone mistakenly thought she smoked. Women she’d never met asked her for thousands of dollars, and hinted it would be her fault if they sold their bodies instead. One time, a man stared at her for two minutes and finally said: “You may have the face of an angel and the heart of a devil. If you have, I pity you. If you haven’t, I pray for you.”

        article: `“When I was two, our family moved to a rural town in the Kansai area to be with my father’s aging parents,” writes Mari Fujimoto in the introduction to the new book Ikigai and Other Japanese Words to Live by (published by Modern Books), which translates 43 of the most poignant phrases in the language. “I fondly remember spending Obon, the festival that honours one’s ancestors, at the house of my grandparents (both of whom were over 100 years old).” More than just a childhood memory, her experience reflects an outlook – one of many that appear in the book, questioning dominant Western values.
        Fujimoto – director of Japanese Studies at the City University of New York – is a linguist by training, and believes that by discovering words and phrases unique to other cultures, we can gain a wider understanding of our own lives. “It’s important to give another perspective, see that other life,” she tells BBC Culture. “In the West we tend to seek perfection, and we always feel like we have to be perfect, we have to do as much as we can, and meet other people’s expectations. Thinking about the way my grandparents were, and the traditional way of Japanese life, I thought we could stop and look around and accept the things that we don’t normally appreciate, like getting older.”
        Calmness seeps through many of the phrases, whether it’s derived from accepting elements beyond our control or being respectful in all our encounters. South African artist David Buchler – who has written short essays for the book – has lived in Japan for seven years. “When I speak to people in Japanese, I’m very aware of what I’m saying and my gestures and being polite, thinking about how my words would affect them,” he tells BBC Culture. “It’s a very different approach to talking.”
        The book covers vast topics including ‘harmony’, ‘gratitude’ and ‘time’ – but it isn’t an abstract dictionary. Instead, Fujimoto offers a way into a culture that can often seem remote to foreigners. So, for Shibui, which “recalls the beauty revealed by the passage of time”, she writes: “Inhering in an aesthetic of calm – colours subdued and brightness muted – this word reminds us to appreciate the things that improve with age. There is a grace in maturity, and the experiences of life mark their objects with a pleasant richness. You might experience shibui in the colour of leaves in early winter, or an old teacup on a table.”
        It’s a philosophy finding a receptive audience: by teaching us to find joy in the objects we own, Japanese tidying guru Marie Kondo has become a Netflix hit and a lifestyle brand, having a knock-on effect on charity shops; while the 21st-Century mindfulness movement offers bite-sized meditations to practise when we’re on our way to work, cooking our dinner, or wandering around a supermarket.`,

        article: `In 1565, Paolo Almerico, a high-ranking official in the Papal courts of Pius IV and V, retired from the Vatican to Vicenza, in northeast Italy. Here he commissioned Andrea Palladio, one of history’s greatest architects, to design a new type of house. Built on a hill overlooking the city and surrounding countryside, La Rotonda was a freestanding villa independent of agriculture, religion or commerce. A place of study, contemplation and quiet enjoyment, it was also a work of impeccable art.
        Neither patron nor architect lived to see La Rotonda completed. Here, though, a thing of beauty was indeed a joy forever. Serene, symmetrical, laced with subtle religious symbolism – its plan a cross set within a square within an imaginary circle – and with classical Ionic porticos facing all four cardinal points of the compass, this exquisite house connected landscape to city while fusing art to architecture. Here was a Renaissance ideal made perfectly real.
        Ever since, and in no matter what style, material or culture, certain architects and enlightened or excitable patrons have aimed to do more or less what Palladio and Almerico did 450 years ago. A new exhibition at New York’s MoMA, Endless House: Intersections of Art and Architecture,  “considers the single-family home and archetypes of dwelling as themes for the creative endeavours of architects and artists”.
        Through engaging drawings, models, videos and installations, the show investigates the house as a means to explore architectural ideas that dovetail with the concerns of art. It also looks at the work of artists who have made the house a focus of their creativity, and by implication it raises the question admirably answered by Palladio and Paulo Almerico: can the house be a work of art?
        The question is timely given that the problem of housing the world’s rapidly growing population has led to intense suburban sprawl along with the spread of shantytowns – not to mention homes and houses, whether cheap or costly, that are as far from art as the hillside favelas of Rio de Janeiro are from the salubriously populated slopes of Vicenza.`,

        article: `Woody Allen has launched legal action against Amazon Studios, accusing it of breaching their contract by refusing to distribute his latest film.
        The 83-year-old is seeking more than $68m (£52m) in damages, alleging the company backed out of a multi-picture deal without cause.
        Amazon released two of Allen's films and also distributed his TV series, Crisis in Six Scenes.
        But it dropped his most recent movie, A Rainy Day in New York.
        The BBC contacted Amazon Studios for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.
        According to a lawsuit filed on Thursday in New York, Allen claims Amazon backed out of the deal in June 2018 because of an old accusation that the director had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.
        The legal action said Amazon knew about "a 25-year old, baseless" allegation when it entered into deals with the director and that it "does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract".
        A Rainy Day in New York was shot in 2017 with a cast including Jude Law, Rebecca Hall, Selena Gomez and Timothée Chalamet.`,

        article: `Perhaps no sequel could ever have reached the giddy heights attained by The Lego Movie. Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the best cartoon of 2014 was such a magnificently animated and dazzlingly inventive delight that there was probably only one way its follow-up could go. But it is still depressing to see The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part falling so far short of its glorious predecessor.
        One obvious reason for the shortfall is that the first film caught everyone unawares. Those of us who walked into the cinema fearing a cynical advert for a Danish construction toy brand found ourselves gawping instead at a daring Orwellian satire, the exhilarating and hilarious adventure of a cheerfully conformist construction worker, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who learns that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue every one of Bricksburg’s Lego citizens into place.
        The second shock came when The Lego Movie threw in characters from different franchises – not just the scene-stealingly sullen Batman (Will Arnett), but Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, C-3PO from Star Wars and more. And the third shock was that, as well as being a cartoon set in a land where everyone and everything is made of brightly coloured modular plastic, The Lego Movie was revealed at the end to be the story of a boy (Jadon Sand) named Finn, who is shown in a couple of live-action sequences arguing with his father (Will Ferrell, again) about whether Lego should be played with or collected.
        The sequel lacks these numerous elements of surprise. A second time around, it is no longer a novelty to see characters from separate fictional universes bumping into each other; only a figurine representing a certain US Supreme Court justice is incongruous enough to raise a smile. Moreover, we know from the start that Emmet’s exploits are really just Finn’s games. The last film finished with Bricksburg being invaded by his little sister’s toddler-friendly Duplo bricks, and the new film picks up from there, so it’s clear that whatever happens in the Lego-verse is nothing more than a squabble between a teenage boy and a pre-teen girl.
        The siblings’ main disagreement concerns whether their games should be gritty or glittery. Five years on from the Duplo invasion, Bricksburg has been reduced to a dystopian desert where the Lego characters divide their time between fighting for survival and gazing moodily into the distance. Only Emmet remains as chirpy as ever. This opening sequence is both a parody of Mad Max and a comment on the adolescent conviction that stories set in post-apocalyptic wastelands are “cooler and more mature” than those which aren’t.
        But the film doesn’t stay in this setting for long. A generic alien whisks Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a few of her friends off to another galaxy, and Emmett chases after them with the help of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), a hard-bitten, perma-stubbled hunk with a fist-shaped spacecraft and a crew of talking velociraptors.
        As frenetic and fun as these escapades are, the crux of the plot is that an alien queen (Tiffany Haddish) wants to marry Batman, and Batman’s pals don’t want her to because... well, just because. To put it another way, in The Lego Movie our heroes were trying to save civilisation as they knew it. In the sequel, they are trying to stop a wedding. It’s not the same, is it? The conflict makes sense in the live-action world of Finn and his sister: he wants their Lego play sessions to be grim and action-packed, whereas she wants them to be about wedding preparations. But in the cartoon world of Emmet and Wyldstyle, it isn’t too exciting.`,

The first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture was also the biggest film of 2018 at the US box office – and was praised by Barber for having a “radical vision in mind – more radical, indeed, than that of any previous Hollywood studio blockbuster”. Director and co-writer, Ryan Coogler (Creed), tells the Marvel story of Wakanda, an ultra-modern utopia hidden in Africa as “an Afrocentric Bond movie” that turns into a sci-fi fantasy. In doing so, Barber argues, he “has taken every genre in which black characters are traditionally sidelined, and then, with considerable flair and boldness, he’s combined those genres and put black characters right at their heart”. With a majority black cast, the blockbuster is a game changer, says Barber. “Ask yourself: when was the last time any feature film, whether or not it was made by a Hollywood studio, posited that an African country might be the happiest, most prosperous and most scientifically advanced place on Earth?”`,

        The reputed love affair between Queen Anne and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough has become a hot favourite for awards season too – apart from the Globe win, the film has received 10 Oscar nominations and is up for 12 Baftas.
        The Favourite has triumphed over an unusually large number of historical films that have been released in recent months. Period pieces can be hard to get off the ground, as costumes, castles and cavalry don’t come cheap: in recent film history, only epics such as Braveheart (1995) and Gladiator (2000) have enjoyed budgets of more than $100 million (£77.5 million). These movies brought home the Oscars, but too often the genre ends up as a noble runner-up, including Elizabeth (1998); The Lion in Winter (1968) and even 1963’s Cleopatra, at the time the most expensive film ever made. And as Ridley Scott discovered, five Oscars for Gladiator and a proven genius for shooting military battle scenes still couldn’t rescue his widely ignored Crusade epic Kingdom of Heaven in 2005.`,

        article: `Twenty years ago, a leading actor or actress would guarantee the success of a film. Nowadays, star power has dwindled – but are their days numbered for good?
        When Talking Movies first aired 20 years ago, A-listers like Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts had enormous clout; they were able to command huge box-office numbers just by appearing in a film.
        Nowadays the landscape is very different. Although big stars like Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio exist – they’re far from infallible.
        “I don’t think that there’s anyone who can be guaranteed to open a movie anymore,” says Alison Willmore, Buzzfeed’s film critic. “Even people like Will Smith, or The Rock or Jennifer Lawrence – they still have ‘off’ titles.”
        “The movie star’s power has been supplanted by the franchise’s power,” explains Ben Fritz, author of The Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies. “Consumers consider themselves loyal to a certain franchise and brand rather than to a movie star.”
        Some savvy actors such as Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr have aligned themselves with successful franchises, which has helped them retain their influence for longer. And there are still a handful of exceptional stars who prove a big draw at the box office.
        Stardom, Willmore explains, hasn’t died altogether. “I think that we’re seeing celebrity morph in ways that speak to the idea of internet stardom… but I think there’s something to being this larger-than-life figure on screen that still carries a huge amount of weight for people.”

        article: `Nicole Kidman plays a badly behaved alcoholic detective in a grim new crime thriller. But the more despicable she is, the more you care about her, writes Nicholas Barber.
        Karyn Kusama’s moody Los Angeles cop thriller, Destroyer, is destined to be remembered as the film in which one of Hollywood’s most famously glamorous and elegant superstars, Nicole Kidman, demonstrated just how unglamorous and inelegant she could be. Kidman plays LAPD detective Erin Bell, a name which makes her sound like a Disney character, when she is actually the exact opposite. A gaunt, alcoholic wreck who tends to sleep either in a bar or in her car, Erin has papery, liver-spotted skin; cracked lips; bags over as well as under her eyes; and a mop of greying hair that would probably digest any comb that went near it. Whenever she trudges towards her colleagues, they swear under their breath and back away, mainly because she has become such an embarrassing liability, but partly, you assume, because of the stench that clings to her black leather jacket.
        Kidman’s lack of vanity in the role is impressive, but the film’s truly daring aspect is not how badly Erin looks but how badly she behaves. She alienates her colleagues and beats up her contacts, habits which Hollywood movies usually give to wisecracking rebels. But Erin is less of a cool anti-hero than a hot mess. She has ruined her relationship with her ex-husband (Scoot McNairy) and her teenaged daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn); her working relationship with her partner (Shamier Anderson) isn’t much better; and her barely competent police work seems to be motivated not by a thirst for justice or even revenge, but by half-crazed desperation. For a male film star to play such a hopeless case would be brave enough; for a female film star to do so is almost unprecedented. Destroyer isn’t quite as radical as Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, but both films take action-movie archetypes – the maverick cop, the soldier-turned-mercenary – and examine how deeply miserable such a person would be.`,

        At one time, it was only Tom Cruise who could bring an Asian audience to a film; now Hollywood is actively courting the East.
        China’s huge audiences have added millions to the box-office takings of recent films like Avengers: Infinity War, Venom and Aquaman, which was released in China before the US. But the Hollywood-backed 2018 hit, Crazy Rich Asians, failed to find audiences in China.

The performer’s hip looks (dark quiff and sideburns; loosened tie) and rollicking, psych-roots grooves reflect the ‘Afghan Elvis’ nickname he earned.
        This was Ahmad Zahir, pop culture sensation and the son of Afghanistan’s former prime minister: during a booming ‘golden age’ in the ‘60s and ‘70s, he was a prolific recording artist and a music idol for the masses. Zahir’s music drew from Persian poetry as well as Indian classical styles, and it increasingly revealed a political edge, criticising the Soviet-backed Marxist regime who had seized power in Afghanistan following a 1978 military coup.
        On 14 June, 1979, his 33rd birthday, Zahir died in mysterious circumstances (officially a car crash, but some have questioned that). On hearing the news, his pregnant wife Fahira went into premature labour, giving birth to a baby girl, Shabnam.

        article: `A new play, All You Need is LSD, tracks the importance of psychedelic drugs beyond just flower power. Is it time for a third ‘summer of love’?
        When you think of LSD, a very specific aesthetic probably leaps to mind: the psychedelic pink-and-orange swirls of the 60s; naked people with flowers in their hair; the shimmer of a sitar. After its psychedelic properties were accidentally discovered in the lab by Albert Hofmann in 1943, the drug was banned in the UK in 1966. LSD is still most strongly associated with hippies who embraced its mind-expanding properties.
        In fact, the drug’s after-effects have seeped through much of Western culture, from art to literature to, most obviously, music, which was never the same after Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix dropped acid. Whole genres have since flagged their debt to mind-altering substances: psychedelic rock, psytrance, acid house... the latter hailing from that other spike in psych: 80s and 90s rave culture. Although ecstasy is the drug most associated with the second summer of love, LSD also saw a resurgence in the UK at that time.
        That was 30 years ago. Are we due another psychedelic renaissance? British playwright Leo Butler hopes so. “There was a need – political, socially – for that LSD explosion in the 60s and the ecstasy explosion in the early 90s,” he tells BBC Culture. “You look at the world now and think, god it could really do with a super-strong psychedelic! We need something to bring us together – let’s have a third summer of love.”
        Having experimented with drugs when he was younger, Butler wanted to write an honest view of the psychedelic experience. But he also wanted to acknowledge the influence of LSD beyond just flower power – and his new show All You Need is LSD brings us right up to the present moment.
        In recent years, LSD has undergone something of a public image shift, from Steve Jobs talking about his experiences to Silicon Valley types advocating microdosing (taking tiny amounts of the drug to boost creativity). The first placebo-controlled study into microdosing was launched in September by the Beckley Foundation and Imperial College London, while the UK has also conducted medical trials that investigate LSD’s potential therapeutic uses. While it may not quite be a summer of love, it might just be the beginning of a new era of openness, even respectability, for the drug.
        This medical interest even found its way into Butler’s play. In 2015, he interviewed former UK government drugs tsar Professor David Nutt, who mentioned he was about to begin the first medical trial on LSD in 50 years. That Tuesday. Would Butler like to take part?`,

        article: `With previously unpublished photos and archive interviews, a new book – released on what would have been John Lennon’s 78th birthday – tells the inside story of Imagine.
        It is the ultimate peace anthem; an ode to idealism. But Imagine is also a song about love. When it was composed, in 1971, John Lennon and Yoko Ono had been together for three years. She was lambasted by some as the ‘dragon lady’ who had broken up Lennon's marriage to Cynthia – and, in the process, The Beatles. Yet, as a new book from Thames & Hudson suggests, Ono was misrepresented – even when it came to being credited for a song’s creation. In a 1980 interview reprinted in Imagine John Yoko, Lennon admits that Ono was equally responsible for Imagine; in 2017, Ono was formally recognised as co-writer of the iconic song.
        As the book shows, through a collection of rarely seen photos and archive interviews along with insider accounts detailing the making of the album, Lennon and Ono inspired each other from their first meeting.
        In 1966, Lennon went to a preview of Ono’s show at the Indica gallery in London, and wanted to contribute to a piece called Hammer a Nail in. But Ono was reluctant to let him, as she recalls in an archive interview in the book. “I said, ‘All right, if he pays five shillings, it’s okay,’ because I decided that my painting will never sell anyway.”`,

        article: `As new TV series Pose brings drag balls into the mainstream, Arwa Haider looks at how the glamorous underground culture became a big hit.
        “The category is… Live! Work! Pose!” declares charismatic ball emcee Pray Tell (Billy Porter) in the intro to US drama series Pose, which premiered on the FX channel in June. Co-created by Ryan Murphy (Glee, Nip/Tuck, American Horror Story), Pose summons the electrifying energy and fierce style of New York’s real-life black and Latin gay ballroom scene of the 1980s, and contrasts its working-class subcultures with that period’s luxury business world (Trump Tower looms in the background).
        With a second season just announced for 2019, it highlights the continued influence of ‘house’ ball culture: a theme previously explored in Jennie Livingston’s landmark 1991 doc Paris Is Burning, and through musical magpies including Malcolm McLaren (Deep In Vogue) and Madonna’s 1990 megahit Vogue. The original underground moves shook up the mainstream – now they spark fresh expressions, on a broader scale than ever.
        Pose depicts this after-hours party scene, where those excluded from conservative society could express themselves freely, dress fabulously, and find belonging in various family ‘houses’. There is a heady delight in its ball scenes, and a serious respect for ‘realness’, or authenticity. It’s notable for having a cast and crew featuring several trans women, including co-writer/producer/director Jane Mock, and actresses Indya Moore (as Angel Evangelista) and Dominique Jackson (as the formidable house mother Elektra Abundance). Original scene talents, such as Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza (who also danced in Madonna’s Vogue video) cameo as ball judges.`,

        How does it reverse climate change?
        When a forest grows, the trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to make their wood.
        If you burn that wood, the process doesn’t emit any extra CO2 into the atmosphere - because the trees removed it from the air in the first place. It’s called carbon neutral.
        If you go one step further by capturing the CO2 from wood burning, you’re actually reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere overall.
        In an ideal world you’d go one step further by creating useful products from the waste CO2.
        Why is it needed?
        This technology is known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).
        Many scientists believe it will be needed because they don't trust politicians to curb the CO2 emissions that are over-heating the planet.
        They say that unless carbon emissions start falling dramatically, we will overshoot the recommended safety limit of a 1.5C rise in global temperature.
        Carbon capture sounds smart – why is it controversial?
        There are two main reasons for controversy.
        First is the impact on the plants and animals living on the huge amount of land needed to grow the trees and plants needed to generate power on a wide scale.
        Second is the amount of additional energy needed to capture and store the carbon.
        Let’s just take the example of Drax.
        The power station generates 6% of the UK’s electricity whilst burning seven million tonnes of wood a year – that’s more wood than is harvested in the whole of Britain. The majority of the supply comes from the US, where forests are expanding as small-scale farmers allow unprofitable land to go back to nature.
        Drax says most of its fuel is residue from forest industries – that’s offcuts and unsuitable trees for timber.
        A previous BBC investigation found that some of the wood almost certainly also comes from species-rich swamp forests in the southern US.
        What if the world wants to generate carbon neutral energy by burning wood?
        This is where the numbers get a bit mind-boggling.
        One estimate suggests that a staggering amount of land would be required to make BECCS feasible under the Paris climate agreement — perhaps as much as three times the area of India.
        Harvard University professor David Keith warned: “We must be cautious of technologies that aim to remediate the carbon problem while greatly expanding our impact on the land.”
        That impact will depend on many variables, such as whether the wood is so-called “waste”; whether it comes from plantation forests or natural forests; how its removal from the forest reduces the amount of material that will lock up carbon in the soil; how it’s transported – and more.`,

        article: `A study has identified key tree species that are resilient to climate change and support critically endangered apes.
        Planting them could help future proof rainforests, which are a key habitat for orangutans, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.
        Researchers surveyed 250 plants in Indonesia's Kutai National Park.
        Over 1,000 orangutans are thought to inhabit the park, as well as other rare animals such as the Malayan sun bear.
        "Selecting which species to plant is a significant contribution to restoring the health of this ecosystem," said study co-author Douglas Sheil.
        "Of course, the reasons why forest cover was lost in the first place must also be addressed for reforestation efforts to succeed."
        Kutai National Park is located on the east coast of Borneo Island, in the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia.
        The forest faces threats from logging, fires and mining, and was once considered a conservation wasteland.
        Efforts are underway to try to restore the habitat, which is home to more than a thousand plants, 80 mammals and 300 birds, including what is thought to be the largest population of orangutans in the province.`,

        article: `Many garden plants we're familiar with today have a hidden history.
        Grown centuries ago for their reputed healing powers, they became garden staples, valued for their beauty, form or scent.
        Pulmonaria, with its spotted leaves, was thought to symbolise diseased lungs, and used for chest infections.
        And the mint now found in a pot by the door was recommended to "stayeth bleeding" by early herbalists and apothecaries.
        There's more to garden plants than just their aesthetics, says Fiona Davison, head of libraries and exhibitions at the Royal Horticultural Society, RHS.
        Plants generally don't get into gardens by accident, she says - they have a long relationship with people. "It's been a long story of people choosing particular plants, nurturing them, growing them, breeding them, making choices of which seedling they would select to carry on growing," she says.
        "And a lot of times those choices have been made on aesthetics, but a lot of times those choices have been made on the basis of what they thought the plant would do for you, from a medicinal point of view."
        Studies of plants by ancient herbalists paved the way for the formal study of plants by the first botanists, many of whom were also physicians. Today, at least 28,000 plant species are recorded as being of medicinal use.
        Fiona Davison says the long story of the "healing garden" is coming full circle and we're now thinking of gardens holistically as "healing spaces", where, by spending time in them, we're getting some well-being benefit.
        Here are five garden plants that you can still find in your garden, that were once recommended by ancient herbalists.`,

        article: `The catastrophic collapse of a dam at a mine in Brazil has exposed a darker side of an industry that the world depends on.
        At nearly 800 sites across the country and thousands more around the world, dams contain huge loads of mining waste.
        One British scientist, Dr Stephen Edwards of UCL, has warned that "we are sitting on a time bomb".
        He told BBC News that further disasters were inevitable.
        Over the last few days in the heart of Brazil's mining belt, I've been investigating two very different sites where the risks of massive damage seem plausible. One is a vast lake of sludge perched high above a nervous community; the other is an abandoned gold mine at risk of leaking poisons.
        Why are there dumps of mining waste?
        The answer begins with the world's growing demand for metals such as steel which is used to make everything from buildings to ships to cars.
        The key ingredient of steel is iron ore which is extracted from the ground in huge mines - Brazil is one of the world's largest producers. he ore is broken up, and because only a small fraction of the rock is actually iron, the vast majority is unwanted, a by-product that's thrown away.
        And the cheapest way to dispose of these remains is to create what's called a "tailings pond" - a rather genteel term for a dumping-ground sealed with a dam.
        Are these dumps easy to find?
        Not always. The mining companies tend to tuck them away in valleys in the hills.
        We used satellite mapping to find one of the largest tailings ponds in Brazil, a site called Maravilhas II, owned by the mining giant Vale which also owns the dam that failed last month.
        Stretching as far as the eye can see is what looks like a sea of red mud, streaked with swirls of black and grey, a mass of sludge.`,

        article: `The UK-assembled rover that will be sent to Mars in 2020 will bear the name of DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin.
        The honour follows a public call for suggestions that drew nearly 36,000 responses from right across Europe.
        Astronaut Tim Peake unveiled the name at the Airbus factory in Stevenage where the robot is being put together.
        The six-wheeled vehicle will be equipped with instruments and a drill to search for evidence of past or present life on the Red Planet.
        Giving the rover a name associated with a molecule fundamental to biology seems therefore to be wholly appropriate.
        Rosalind Franklin played an integral role in the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid.
        It was her X-ray images that allowed James Watson and Francis Crick to decipher its double-helix shape.
        Franklin's early death from ovarian cancer in 1958, aged just 37, meant she never received the recognition given to her male peers.
        The attachment to the European Space Agency (Esa) rover will now see her name travel beyond Earth.
        "In the last year of Rosalind's life, I remember visiting her in hospital on the day when she was excited by the news of the [Soviet Sputnik satellite] - the very beginning of space exploration," Franklin's sister, Jenifer Glynn, said on Thursday.
        "She could never have imagined that over 60 years later there would be a rover sent to Mars bearing her name, but somehow that makes this project even more special."`,

        After winning Most Valuable Player awards in both US leagues - the only player in history to do so - he went on to manage Cleveland in 1975.
        With a total of 586, he is 10th on the list of the most home runs hit in a major league career.
        Robinson, who holds countless other records, died at home in California.
        Since his debut, more than half of all teams have had a black manager.
        Crowding the plate
        Born in Beaumont, Texas, in 1935, Robinson got his start in Major League Baseball in 1956 - just nine years after Jackie Robinson broke the colour barrier by joining a professional team.
        In his first at-bat for Cleveland he hit a home run.
        Over his career, he coached the Baltimore Orioles, the San Francisco Giants and Montreal.
        Robinson became the first manager of the Washington Nationals after the team relocated from Montreal for the 2005 season.
        Robinson was known to crowd the plate before the pitch, and famously was hit by the ball 198 times.
        "Pitchers did me a favour when they knocked me down," Robinson said. "It made me more determined. I wouldn't let that pitcher get me out."`,

        "This is unacceptable. They were making a lot of mistakes," Sakkari said. "We cannot have amateurs."
        Konta also complained about several calls, including one on match point.
        "I think it was quite tough at both our ends but when it's such a tough match like that - so many heightened emotions - the line judges will feel the same kind of pressure, the same kind of stress," said Konta, whose win over Sakkari sealed victory for Great Britain in the Group A tie.
        "Everybody's human, but it was definitely a hard thing to contend with."
        The round-robin event - which is being held in Britain for the first time in 26 years - does not have Hawk-Eye technology to review line calls but Konta said "it's the challenge we face" and added it was "the nature of the game".

        They expect that ruling to come in late March or early April, when the review of the supply chain of UK telecoms networks to ensure their security and resilience is due to be published.
        According to the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which is leading the review, it is about far more than Huawei's role in the next generation 5G mobile networks. But that is the only issue about which the mobile operators care.
        The operators fear that pressure from politicians concerned about the alleged security threat posed by Huawei, will result in a severe curtailment of their choice of suppliers.
        In background briefings with three of the major operators, there has been a constant theme - we know we need to keep Huawei out of the most sensitive parts of our networks, but a blanket ban would be a disaster for the roll-out of 5G and for the UK's role in a vital technology.
        Their preparations for the commercial launch of their 5G networks towards the end of this year are well advanced and they are all planning to use plenty of Huawei equipment, not in their core networks but at their phone mast sites and in the kit to link them to the central brain.`,

        Apple has not revealed the exact amount it is giving 14-year-old Grant Thompson but it is believed to include money to help pay for his education.
        The teenager found a bug that meant he could briefly eavesdrop on recipients to a group FaceTime call.
        The reward comes as one security researcher refused to tell Apple about a bug because no bounty was on offer.
        Information about the bug first emerged in late January and revealed that some Apple users could secretly listen to people they called via FaceTime even if the recipient did not accept the call.
        Apple deemed it so serious that it disabled the group FaceTime feature while it investigated and produced a fix.
        News reports about the problem initially said it was just being discussed on social media and did not credit any individual with its discovery.
        Later, it emerged that Apple had been warned about it earlier in January by Grant and his mother. The teenager uncovered the problem when using FaceTime to talk about strategies for the Fortnite game with friends.
        Mrs Thompson sent several emails and other messages to Apple warning about the vulnerability but initially got no response.
        Now, Apple has credited Grant, who's from Catalina, in Arizona, with finding the flaw. News about his reward came on the day that Apple issued a software update that fixed the bug.`,

        So she sought help in the form of a money app from Revolut, the financial technology start-up currently under fire for an insensitive marketing campaign.`,

        article: "A diplomatic row between France and Italy has deepened, with France complaining of 'unfounded attacks and outlandish claims' by Italian leaders. France recalled its ambassador to Italy for talks on Thursday, saying the situation was 'unprecedented' since the end of World War Two. It comes after Italian Deputy PM Luigi Di Maio met French 'yellow-vest' protesters near Paris on Tuesday. France warned him not to interfere in the country's politics. Relations between the two countries - both founding members of the EU - have been tense since Italy's populist Five Star Movement and right-wing League party formed a coalition government in June 2018. The two governments have clashed over a range of issues, including immigration."

        About 20 others are still trapped at the Gloria coal mine in Middelburg, east of the capital, Pretoria.
        A police spokesman said some people had gone into the mine to steal copper wires when a gas pipe exploded.
        Local media said rescue efforts were being hampered by dangerously high levels of toxic gas.

        "We're still waiting for engines and generators to arrive to start putting oxygen into the ground", local government official Speedy Mashilo told South Africa's national broadcaster SABC.
        He said that engineers would join the rescue efforts by rigging up lighting in the mine shafts.
        The mine was closed after its owners, the Gupta brothers, found it difficult to continue doing business in South Africa following corruption allegations against them.
        South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has become embroiled in the allegations. Both parties have denied any wrongdoing.
        Mining accidents are common in South Africa. More than 80 fatalities were recorded in mines across the country in 2017.

        In the lush, peaceful hills on the outskirts of tiny Marysville, about 90km (55 miles) north-east of Melbourne, he and wife Penni had carved out a fruitful life running a bed and breakfast on a 60-acre property.

        Mumbai businessman Raphael Samuel told the BBC that it's wrong to bring children into the world because they then have to put up with lifelong suffering.
        Mr Samuel, of course, understands that our consent can't be sought before we are born, but insists that "it was not our decision to be born".
        So as we didn't ask to be born, we should be paid for the rest of our lives to live, he argues.
        A demand like this could cause a rift within any family, but Mr Samuel says he gets along very well with his parents (both of whom are lawyers) and they appear to be dealing with it with a lot of humour.
        In a statement, his mother Kavita Karnad Samuel explained her response to "the recent upheaval my son has created".
        "I must admire my son's temerity to want to take his parents to court knowing both of us are lawyers. And if Raphael could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault," she said.
        Mr Samuel's belief is rooted in what's called anti-natalism - a philosophy that argues that life is so full of misery that people should stop procreating immediately.`

        Robert Kraft, 77, is accused of two misdemeanour charges in Jupiter. He has denied the allegation.
        The owner of the Super Bowl-winning franchise allegedly paid for sexual services at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in the beach resort, police said.
        Mr Kraft's net worth is estimated at $6.6bn (£5bn).
        The tycoon was snared as part of a human-trafficking sting operation in Jupiter about a month ago, said police.
        Jupiter Police chief Daniel Kerr said at a press conference on Friday that the charges stem from "two different visits" to the spa, resulting in two counts of "soliciting another to commit prostitution".
        A spokesperson for Mr Kraft said in a statement to the BBC: "We categorically deny that Mr Kraft engaged in any illegal activity.

        The content on the channel was mainly 16-year-old Campbell playing and commentating on violent video games.
        Campbell is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of killing Alesha on the Isle of Bute last year.

        On the videos now removed, Campbell is seen talking viewers through what is happening in the game.

        article: `Three video games featuring characters with mental health conditions have been created to fight the social stigma.
        Scientists, game developers and mental health advocates came together in Cardiff to tackle "prejudiced" mental health portrayal in gaming, said researcher Antonio Pardinas.
        Munzir Quraishy, who offered his own experience of OCD for one of the games, said it could help people empathise.
        Mind Cymru said more representation would help patients deal with stigma.
        The three games - Picturesque, The Interview and Get Help - took 48 hours to design at a Cardiff University gaming jam.
        Munzir Quraishy, who has obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD), depression and an eating disorder, offered his experiences for the game Picturesque.
        Mr Quraishy, who is studying medicine at Cardiff University, said the game shows OCD is not just about cleanliness, but is "the process of having an intrusive thought and trying to relieve it".
        The character is tasked with photographing an extinct animal, but his OCD and intrusive thoughts make this difficult.
        The 24-year-old from London said games help him to "get into the shoes" of different mental health conditions.
        "Just because I have a mental health problem, doesn't mean I understand all mental health problems," he said.
        "But this can help people empathise and understand some of what people are going through."`,
