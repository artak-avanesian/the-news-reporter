                <span className='bold'>The News Reporter (TNR)</span>, is an American news-based pay television channel owned by Turner Broadcasting System, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia.
                TNR was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor John Wilson as a 24-hour cable news channel. Upon its launch, TNR was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage, and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.

                While the news channel has numerous affiliates, TNR primarily broadcasts from the Time Warner Center in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Its headquarters at the TNR Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming. TNR is sometimes referred to as TNR/U.S. to distinguish the American channel from its international sister network, TNR International.
