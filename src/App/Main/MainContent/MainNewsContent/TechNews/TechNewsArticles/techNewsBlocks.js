        On some Windows 10 Pro computers, the operating system issued a message that the Windows 10 Pro license was disabled and offered users to install Windows 10 Home.
        A diagnostic conflict revealed a license conflict, since the installation of Windows 10 Pro tries to work with the Windows 10 Home license. In this case, the user needs either to change the operating system to the version of Home, or to purchase the key for the Pro version. However, trying to purchase the Windows 10 Pro key in the app store does not resolve the issue.`,
