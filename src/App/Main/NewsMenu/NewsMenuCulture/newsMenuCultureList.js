            `Clash of the Titans was one of the most popular films of 1981. Its glittering retinue of Hollywood stars told the story of Perseus, the demigod from Greek mythology who kills a sea monster and saves the beautiful princess Andromeda from being said monster’s lunch. Such was the film’s popularity that it was remade in 2010; the film managed a rather disparaging 26% on the Rotten Tomatoes site. How many of those rating the film had a classical education is unclear, but perhaps it would have performed better had its producers done their research. As according to British art historian Elizabeth McGrath’s 1992 article The Black Andromeda, Andromeda was, indeed, originally depicted as a black princess from Ethiopia.`,

            `Anyone who watched either of the two Clash of the Titans films will know that Judi Bowker and Alexa Devalos are both white women, and anyone who has seen Andromeda in a painting – perhaps Titian’s or Poynter’s – will believe she is white too. But McGrath’s article was definitive in addressing three things: that all the Greek mythographers placed Andromeda as a princess of Ethiopia, that Ovid specifically refers to her dark skin and that artists throughout Western art history frequently omitted to depict her blackness because Andromeda was supposed to be beautiful, and blackness and beauty – for many of them – was dichotomous. There is no doubt about Andromena’s race, according to Professor McGrath.`,

            `Yet Renaissance art repeatedly depicts Andromeda as white. In Piero di Cosimo’s Perseus Freeing Andromeda from the 1510s she is actually whiter than all the figures around her, including a black musician and her parents, who are considerably darker and in exotic costume. We do know that there was active debate about her skin colour, a debate that would certainly seem racist to modern eyes. McGrath references Francisco Pacheco, a Spanish artist and writer, who asks in one passage of his book Arte de la Pintura why Andromeda is so often painted as white-skinned when several of the sources say she is black. `,

            `When Danish teacher Rita returns from a suspension from her job, she finds that her school has merged with another – and that her mug is missing from the staff room. This small issue escalates quickly, as conflicts often do around Rita. The other school’s headmaster has taken her mug, seemingly on purpose, and is unapologetic. Distinctive with her long hair, leather jacket and endless selection of plaid shirts, Rita confronts him. He knows who she is, by reputation. “A rebel like you shouldn’t care,” he says. He brags about having read her staff file. “Eleven warnings in one year,” he says. “Suspended for sleeping with a pupil’s father.”`,
            `“I must be good, only getting a warning,” she returns.`,
            `“Or else you’re sleeping with Rasmus,” he says, referring to her school’s headmaster.
            This is a scene from the second-season premiere of the Danish hit dramatic-comedy series Rita, and it sums the show up nicely: Rita is a teacher. Rita is unconventional. Rita is unapologetic about sexuality, if a bit lacking in discernment. Rita is, in fact, sleeping with Rasmus. She’s also a single mum who loves her three children – two of them young adults, one a teenager still attending the school where she works.`

            `The US critic Jed Perl once referred to Bonnard as “the most idiosyncratic of all the great 20th-Century painters”. His highly original compositions repeatedly focus on favoured motifs – a dining-room table, the view from a window or his lifelong partner Marthe De Méligny stretched out in a bath. They rely less on traditional modes of pictorial structure than a voluptuous use of colour that comes not from nature but his own interior logic.`,
            `Vibrant shades of viridian green miraculously exist in harmony with the bright blues and oranges of a landscape, while elsewhere shades of mauve, gold and blue ripple across the walls of a bathroom. The resulting compositions combine psychological insight with an often sublime poetic sensibility.`,
            `The deceptive joyfulness of his works combined with the difficulty of identifying him with any one artistic movement has sometimes led to the ground-breaking nature of his work being overlooked. A new exhibition at London’s Tate Modern hopes to show that his continuous and radical experiments with colour and form, which sometimes took him to the brink of abstraction, in fact make him one of the most innovative and unique painters of the 19th and 20th Centuries.`

            `In 1911, William deMille made the most boneheaded prediction in the history of acting. A theatre kid he’d known was quitting the stage for the moving-picture screen. “She can’t be more than 17,” he tut-tutted in a letter, “and now she’s throwing her whole career in the ashcan and burying herself in a cheap form of amusement. There will never be any real money in those galloping tintypes.”`,
            `The theatre was 2,500 years old, and this girl was risking her future on a fad. “Say goodbye to little Mary Pickford. She’ll never be heard of again.”`,
            `Four years later, Mary Pickford was the most famous woman in the world; the first female celebrity not just known by name, reputation or sketch, but even the way the corners of her eyes curled down when she smiled. Everyone who’d seen her in Tess of the Storm Country (1914) or Rags (1915) knew exactly how she looked – long ringlets, childish dresses, the image of innocence – and they froze her like that forever.`,
            `The curls cost $50 each, a fortune when a movie ticket was just over a nickel, and Pickford travelled with a suitcase of them.`,
            `The hair belonged to her, but she belonged to everyone. Strangers stole the flowers from her hat and got upset if she ran around barefoot on film. When a child spotted America’s Sweetheart with a manicure – ”Mama! She’s not a real little girl! She has long fingernails!” – Pickford clipped them short and banned herself from fiddling with lipsticks and pencils in public in case someone mistakenly thought she smoked. Women she’d never met asked her for thousands of dollars, and hinted it would be her fault if they sold their bodies instead. One time, a man stared at her for two minutes and finally said: “You may have the face of an angel and the heart of a devil. If you have, I pity you. If you haven’t, I pray for you.”`

            `“When I was two, our family moved to a rural town in the Kansai area to be with my father’s aging parents,” writes Mari Fujimoto in the introduction to the new book Ikigai and Other Japanese Words to Live by (published by Modern Books), which translates 43 of the most poignant phrases in the language.`,
            `“I fondly remember spending Obon, the festival that honours one’s ancestors, at the house of my grandparents (both of whom were over 100 years old).” More than just a childhood memory, her experience reflects an outlook – one of many that appear in the book, questioning dominant Western values.`,
            `Fujimoto – director of Japanese Studies at the City University of New York – is a linguist by training, and believes that by discovering words and phrases unique to other cultures, we can gain a wider understanding of our own lives. “It’s important to give another perspective, see that other life,” she tells BBC Culture.`,
            `“In the West we tend to seek perfection, and we always feel like we have to be perfect, we have to do as much as we can, and meet other people’s expectations. Thinking about the way my grandparents were, and the traditional way of Japanese life, I thought we could stop and look around and accept the things that we don’t normally appreciate, like getting older.”`,
            `Calmness seeps through many of the phrases, whether it’s derived from accepting elements beyond our control or being respectful in all our encounters. South African artist David Buchler – who has written short essays for the book – has lived in Japan for seven years. “When I speak to people in Japanese, I’m very aware of what I’m saying and my gestures and being polite, thinking about how my words would affect them,” he tells BBC Culture. “It’s a very different approach to talking.”`,
            `The book covers vast topics including ‘harmony’, ‘gratitude’ and ‘time’ – but it isn’t an abstract dictionary. Instead, Fujimoto offers a way into a culture that can often seem remote to foreigners. So, for Shibui, which “recalls the beauty revealed by the passage of time”, she writes: “Inhering in an aesthetic of calm – colours subdued and brightness muted – this word reminds us to appreciate the things that improve with age. There is a grace in maturity, and the experiences of life mark their objects with a pleasant richness.`,
            `You might experience shibui in the colour of leaves in early winter, or an old teacup on a table.”
            It’s a philosophy finding a receptive audience: by teaching us to find joy in the objects we own, Japanese tidying guru Marie Kondo has become a Netflix hit and a lifestyle brand, having a knock-on effect on charity shops; while the 21st-Century mindfulness movement offers bite-sized meditations to practise when we’re on our way to work, cooking our dinner, or wandering around a supermarket.`

            `In 1565, Paolo Almerico, a high-ranking official in the Papal courts of Pius IV and V, retired from the Vatican to Vicenza, in northeast Italy. Here he commissioned Andrea Palladio, one of history’s greatest architects, to design a new type of house. Built on a hill overlooking the city and surrounding countryside, La Rotonda was a freestanding villa independent of agriculture, religion or commerce. A place of study, contemplation and quiet enjoyment, it was also a work of impeccable art.`,
            `Neither patron nor architect lived to see La Rotonda completed. Here, though, a thing of beauty was indeed a joy forever. Serene, symmetrical, laced with subtle religious symbolism – its plan a cross set within a square within an imaginary circle – and with classical Ionic porticos facing all four cardinal points of the compass, this exquisite house connected landscape to city while fusing art to architecture. Here was a Renaissance ideal made perfectly real.`,
            `Ever since, and in no matter what style, material or culture, certain architects and enlightened or excitable patrons have aimed to do more or less what Palladio and Almerico did 450 years ago. A new exhibition at New York’s MoMA, Endless House: Intersections of Art and Architecture,  “considers the single-family home and archetypes of dwelling as themes for the creative endeavours of architects and artists”.`,
            `Through engaging drawings, models, videos and installations, the show investigates the house as a means to explore architectural ideas that dovetail with the concerns of art. It also looks at the work of artists who have made the house a focus of their creativity, and by implication it raises the question admirably answered by Palladio and Paulo Almerico: can the house be a work of art?`,
            `The question is timely given that the problem of housing the world’s rapidly growing population has led to intense suburban sprawl along with the spread of shantytowns – not to mention homes and houses, whether cheap or costly, that are as far from art as the hillside favelas of Rio de Janeiro are from the salubriously populated slopes of Vicenza.`
