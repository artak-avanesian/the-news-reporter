        newsMenuBooksArticle: `“Without a book, so often the child is alone,” says Antonio La Cava.

        The retired schoolteacher converted his three-wheeled van into a mobile library, the Bibliomotocarro. Driving the hills and mountains of Basilicata, Italy, La Cava is able to reach children in remote villages like San Paolo Albanese, which only has two children of primary school age.
        
        “I was strongly worried about growing old in a country of non-readers.” La Cava believes that it’s important to spread the joy of literature to as many children as possible: “carrying out such action has a value, not only social, not only cultural, but has a great ethical meaning.”
        
        La Cava hopes his Bibliomotocarro brings the message that culture is made by and for everyone, not just a privileged few.`,

        newsMenuBooksTitle: `How the science fiction helps readersunderstand climate change`,
        newsMenuBooksImgSrc: ``,
        newsMenuBooksArticle: `It’s the year 2140 and two kids ride their skimboards in the heart of Manhattan, near the point where Sixth Avenue meets Broadway. If you are familiar with this junction you would know it is far from the US’ current coastline. But in Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel New York 2140, Manhattan is flooded after unabated climate change causes the sea level to rise by 50ft (15.25m). The amphibian city is now a SuperVenice, a grid of canals populated by vaporettos where characters must learn how to deal with a world both familiar and unrecognisable to us. Mid-Manhattan skimboading is all too possible in this future.
        Robinson’s 2017 climate-fiction novel belongs to a growing cadre of works about drowned nations, wind farm utopias or scarred metropolises decades into the future. As diplomats draft the rulebook for the global response to the climate crisis and engineers race to produce better solar panels, writers have found their role, too: telling what Robinson calls “the story of the next century”. In doing that, they might be helping readers across the world comprehend the situation in which we currently find ourselves.  
        Climate change is a notoriously elusive crisis to make sense of, particularly compared to other human-impact catastrophes. Drop some toxic chemicals in a river now and you will see dead fish within days, but what do you witness when you release carbon dioxide? And while, in 2018, a report by UN climate scientists stated that we are heading towards a catastrophe, who can truly imagine what that looks like?

        This is where fiction comes in: it brings the abstract data closer to home by focusing on the faces and stories in these futures. Show readers a detailed and textured account of a climate-changed future, says Robinson, and they have an easier time imagining it. It feels real: characters in these novels worry about the welfare of their children, meddle in extra-marital affairs and grapple with train schedules, just as readers would on their daily lives.

        Abstract futures

        “Science fiction gets people thinking in a way that another report on climate change doesn’t,” says Shelley Streeby, a Professor of Literature and Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego. “It helps people feel about what might be coming, but also about the present.”

        The numbers for climate fiction, or cli-fi as some people call it, are hard to pinpoint – but they are growing fast. A 2016 review tallied 50 novels dealing specifically with man-made climate change and its effects, with 20 appearing in the previous five years, although this number includes all types of novels. That includes John Lanchester’s new environmental fable, The Wall, which has been described as “disquieting and quite good fun at the same time”.

        newsMenuBooksArticle: `“The literature… mainly consists of books that were published long before 1933 but then became a thorn in the Nazis’ side for different reasons,” says Gerhard Stumpf, librarian at the University of Augsburg. “Most of them were Jewish authors – others were socialist or Communist authors – and also anti-war authors who experienced the pain of World War One.”

        From 1976 until his death in 2013, Georg P Salzmann collected about 12,000 books that had been banned – and burnt – by the Nazis for being ‘un-German’. His father – a Nazi – had shot himself in 1945, when Georg was a teenager.
        
        What became known as the Library of Burnt Books was sold to the University of Augsburg in 2009 – and is now open to the public. Stumpf describes the first book that Salzmann bought, as well as how one author witnessed his own books being burnt.`,

        newsMenuBooksTitle: `The mysterious, macabre mind of Edward Gorey`,
        newsMenuBooksImgSrc: ``,
        newsMenuBooksArticle: `From the Gashlycrumb Tinies to The Doubtful Guest, Edward Gorey’s morbidly funny little books are gothic surrealist masterpieces. Drawing on sources as varied as the novels of Agatha Christie and French silent film, he created a uniquely macabre vision of the world filled with crumbling English mansions, jittery dark-eyed flappers and stony faced Edwardian gents where nothing is quite as it seems. His virtuosic illustrations and poetic texts have drawn comparisons to Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear and Samuel Beckett, winning him critical acclaim and a devoted cult following in his native US.
        Lemony Snicket.

        Gorey himself was a complicated, reclusive individual whose mission in life was “to make everybody as uneasy as possible”. He collected daguerreotypes of dead babies and lived alone with 20,000 books and six cats in his New York apartment. Sporting an Edwardian beard, he would frequently traipse around the city in a full-length fur coat accessorised with trainers and jangling bracelets.
        A precociously gifted child, he grew up in depression-era Chicago, learning to draw at the age of one-and-a-half and teaching himself to read at three. He had devoured Dracula by the age of five and the complete works of Victor Hugo before he was eight, absorbing a gothic sensibility which would later imprint itself on his work.

        A mystery wrapped in an enigma

        The country house murder mysteries of favourites such as Christie and Dorothy L Sayers nurtured his Anglophilia – although he never actually visited England. Friends believe his fantasy could never have coped with the reality. Regular trips to the theatre, ballet and concerts were instrumental in turning him into a cultural omnivore, a tendency which expanded even further once he entered Harvard after World War Two.

        Here his social circle revolved around what Mark Dery, author of Gorey’s first major biography Born to be Posthumous, refers to as the “gay literati”, including the poet Frank O’Hara with whom he shared a passion for obscure literature. Although most people who met him assumed Gorey was also gay, he was notoriously reticent on the subject. When one interviewer pressed him on his sex life, “he responded: ‘I’m a person first, an artist a distant second and whatever else last,’” says Dery.

        There is certainly an undercurrent of homoeroticism, gender fluidity and same-sex couplings running throughout Gorey’s oeuvre and he noted in a letter to a friend that ‘les boys’, as he phrased it, appeared to be among the first to appreciate his unusual works.
        Gorey’s unique style first came to public notice as a designer of paperback covers for Doubleday’s Anchor Books imprint. His elegantly elongated figures and sombre palette, inspired both by the English illustrator Edward Ardizzone and the Japanese Ukiyo-e prints he loved, were in marked contrast to the pulp fiction-inspired covers prevalent at the time.

        The Anchor job meant a move to New York, which did not enthuse him, but opened up a whole new world of cultural possibilities. At the silent film evenings run by the film historian William K Everson, he discovered the work of French film-maker Louis Feuillade. His gothic-macabre crime thrillers Fantômas and Les Vampires would become “the greatest influence on my work. Period,” Gorey later said. The potted palms, pattern-on-pattern decor in interior sets and mysteriously veiled women in dark clothes who populated his films would become instantly recognisable Gorey motifs.`,

        newsMenuBooksArticle: `A new novel imagines the life of Frieda von Richthofen, the inspiration for many of DH Lawrence’s female characters. Hephzibah Anderson looks at the fate of the literary muse.
        As job descriptions go, few seem to fit the ‘nice work if you can get it’ category more snugly than ‘muse’. Inspiring lasting works of art by simply existing? It’s at once indolent and noble, evocative of days spent lounging on a chaise longue and nights filled with dance and glittering conversation.

        A look at the life of Frieda von Richthofen might leave you feeling rather differently. She was the inspiration – and model – for many of DH Lawrence’s female characters, including his most scandalous, Lady Chatterley. Yet muse, as she lived it, was a far from undemanding role, encompassing everything from lover and confidante to punch bag. At least, that’s the way Annabel Abbs tells it in a new novel based on her life, titled simply Frieda.
        The daughter of a penniless German baron with a roving eye, Frieda craves adventure and intellectual stimulation. Marriage is all that’s available to her and so, in 1899, aged just 20, she weds British philologist Ernest Weekley. They make their home in Nottingham, back then a heavily industrial town whose factories are a chorus of “clanging and clacking, hissing and spitting”, and in whose air particles of soot hover “like swarms of aphids”.
        In Abbs' novel, Weekley turns out to be the kind of chap who’s far happier thinking about his “snowflower” in absentia, as an ideal, than having to engage with the desires and frustrations of a real woman. While he toils over his seminal book, she has three children, the eldest of whom is seven when she begins to feel something stirring within her. She calls it “the what-I-could-be”.

        Her fickle sister suggests a tonic: infidelity. And as history shows, it was through Else von Richthofen that Frieda met maverick psychoanalyst Otto Gross, who did indeed become her lover, though the affair doesn't cure her of her restlessness. Then Mr Lawrence comes to lunch. A scrawny, gifted miner’s son six years her junior, he’s her husband’s former student. It takes just a single charged conversation for their passion to ignite.`,

        newsMenuBooksArticle: `Pedro Corrêa do Lago has the world’s largest private collection of autographed letters and manuscripts. In our video, he reveals unseen gems that are ‘frozen moments in time’.
        “When you hold the letter of someone you admire and who was dead before you were born, I think it’s the closest connection you can have with that sort of person. Because you’re holding a little frozen moment of their life – they may have spent… a long time if it’s a manuscript with that piece of paper, they touched it.”

        Pedro Corrêa do Lago has one of the largest private collections of autographed letters and manuscripts in the world. It includes tens of thousands of handwritten documents from 5000 of the most important figures in the fields of art, literature, history, science, music and entertainment since 1153. They have just been brought together in a new book, The Magic of Handwriting.
        There’s a marble order sketched by Michelangelo; Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s first and last known letters; Sigmund Freud’s bill for 20 sessions; a letter from Emily Dickinson; Puccini’s score for Girl of the Golden West; drafts for In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust; a sketch of the Tramp’s accessories by Charlie Chaplin; and a letter from Mary Shelley a few months after the death of her husband Percy Shelley, asking Italian authorities to hand over the boat in which he drowned and all its contents. There’s also a letter from Wolfgang Mozart to his father Leopold, mentioning that he’s been dating a young singer – something that might have troubled Leopold, who wanted his son to focus instead on his studies.

        Corrêa do Lago tells BBC Culture what it’s like to hold a piece of handwritten history in his hands. “It’s the moment of creation that is materialised in that piece of paper.”`,
