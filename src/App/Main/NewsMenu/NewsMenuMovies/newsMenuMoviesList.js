        newsMenuMoviesArticle: `Perhaps no sequel could ever have reached the giddy heights attained by The Lego Movie. Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the best cartoon of 2014 was such a magnificently animated and dazzlingly inventive delight that there was probably only one way its follow-up could go. But it is still depressing to see The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part falling so far short of its glorious predecessor.

        One obvious reason for the shortfall is that the first film caught everyone unawares. Those of us who walked into the cinema fearing a cynical advert for a Danish construction toy brand found ourselves gawping instead at a daring Orwellian satire, the exhilarating and hilarious adventure of a cheerfully conformist construction worker, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who learns that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue every one of Bricksburg’s Lego citizens into place.
        
        The second shock came when The Lego Movie threw in characters from different franchises – not just the scene-stealingly sullen Batman (Will Arnett), but Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, C-3PO from Star Wars and more. And the third shock was that, as well as being a cartoon set in a land where everyone and everything is made of brightly coloured modular plastic, The Lego Movie was revealed at the end to be the story of a boy (Jadon Sand) named Finn, who is shown in a couple of live-action sequences arguing with his father (Will Ferrell, again) about whether Lego should be played with or collected.
        
        The sequel lacks these numerous elements of surprise. A second time around, it is no longer a novelty to see characters from separate fictional universes bumping into each other; only a figurine representing a certain US Supreme Court justice is incongruous enough to raise a smile. Moreover, we know from the start that Emmet’s exploits are really just Finn’s games. The last film finished with Bricksburg being invaded by his little sister’s toddler-friendly Duplo bricks, and the new film picks up from there, so it’s clear that whatever happens in the Lego-verse is nothing more than a squabble between a teenage boy and a pre-teen girl.
        
        The siblings’ main disagreement concerns whether their games should be gritty or glittery. Five years on from the Duplo invasion, Bricksburg has been reduced to a dystopian desert where the Lego characters divide their time between fighting for survival and gazing moodily into the distance. Only Emmet remains as chirpy as ever. This opening sequence is both a parody of Mad Max and a comment on the adolescent conviction that stories set in post-apocalyptic wastelands are “cooler and more mature” than those which aren’t.
        
        But the film doesn’t stay in this setting for long. A generic alien whisks Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a few of her friends off to another galaxy, and Emmett chases after them with the help of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), a hard-bitten, perma-stubbled hunk with a fist-shaped spacecraft and a crew of talking velociraptors.
        
        As frenetic and fun as these escapades are, the crux of the plot is that an alien queen (Tiffany Haddish) wants to marry Batman, and Batman’s pals don’t want her to because... well, just because. To put it another way, in The Lego Movie our heroes were trying to save civilisation as they knew it. In the sequel, they are trying to stop a wedding. It’s not the same, is it? The conflict makes sense in the live-action world of Finn and his sister: he wants their Lego play sessions to be grim and action-packed, whereas she wants them to be about wedding preparations. But in the cartoon world of Emmet and Wyldstyle, it isn’t too exciting.`,

        The first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture was also the biggest film of 2018 at the US box office – and was praised by Barber for having a “radical vision in mind – more radical, indeed, than that of any previous Hollywood studio blockbuster”. Director and co-writer, Ryan Coogler (Creed), tells the Marvel story of Wakanda, an ultra-modern utopia hidden in Africa as “an Afrocentric Bond movie” that turns into a sci-fi fantasy. In doing so, Barber argues, he “has taken every genre in which black characters are traditionally sidelined, and then, with considerable flair and boldness, he’s combined those genres and put black characters right at their heart”. With a majority black cast, the blockbuster is a game changer, says Barber. “Ask yourself: when was the last time any feature film, whether or not it was made by a Hollywood studio, posited that an African country might be the happiest, most prosperous and most scientifically advanced place on Earth?”`,

        newsMenuMoviesArticle: `Olivia Colman, an Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner for her performance as Queen Anne in The Favourite, tells the BBC she believes that the historical film has “reinvented the genre. It’s messy and you can almost smell the period it’s set in.”

        The reputed love affair between Queen Anne and Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough has become a hot favourite for awards season too – apart from the Globe win, the film has received 10 Oscar nominations and is up for 12 Baftas.
        
        The Favourite has triumphed over an unusually large number of historical films that have been released in recent months. Period pieces can be hard to get off the ground, as costumes, castles and cavalry don’t come cheap: in recent film history, only epics such as Braveheart (1995) and Gladiator (2000) have enjoyed budgets of more than $100 million (£77.5 million). These movies brought home the Oscars, but too often the genre ends up as a noble runner-up, including Elizabeth (1998); The Lion in Winter (1968) and even 1963’s Cleopatra, at the time the most expensive film ever made. And as Ridley Scott discovered, five Oscars for Gladiator and a proven genius for shooting military battle scenes still couldn’t rescue his widely ignored Crusade epic Kingdom of Heaven in 2005.`,

        newsMenuMoviesArticle: `Twenty years ago, a leading actor or actress would guarantee the success of a film. Nowadays, star power has dwindled – but are their days numbered for good?
        When Talking Movies first aired 20 years ago, A-listers like Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts had enormous clout; they were able to command huge box-office numbers just by appearing in a film.

        Nowadays the landscape is very different. Although big stars like Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio exist – they’re far from infallible.

        “I don’t think that there’s anyone who can be guaranteed to open a movie anymore,” says Alison Willmore, Buzzfeed’s film critic. “Even people like Will Smith, or The Rock or Jennifer Lawrence – they still have ‘off’ titles.”

        “The movie star’s power has been supplanted by the franchise’s power,” explains Ben Fritz, author of The Big Picture: The Fight for the Future of Movies. “Consumers consider themselves loyal to a certain franchise and brand rather than to a movie star.”

        Some savvy actors such as Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr have aligned themselves with successful franchises, which has helped them retain their influence for longer. And there are still a handful of exceptional stars who prove a big draw at the box office.

        Stardom, Willmore explains, hasn’t died altogether. “I think that we’re seeing celebrity morph in ways that speak to the idea of internet stardom… but I think there’s something to being this larger-than-life figure on screen that still carries a huge amount of weight for people.”

        newsMenuMoviesArticle: `Nicole Kidman plays a badly behaved alcoholic detective in a grim new crime thriller. But the more despicable she is, the more you care about her, writes Nicholas Barber.
        Karyn Kusama’s moody Los Angeles cop thriller, Destroyer, is destined to be remembered as the film in which one of Hollywood’s most famously glamorous and elegant superstars, Nicole Kidman, demonstrated just how unglamorous and inelegant she could be. Kidman plays LAPD detective Erin Bell, a name which makes her sound like a Disney character, when she is actually the exact opposite. A gaunt, alcoholic wreck who tends to sleep either in a bar or in her car, Erin has papery, liver-spotted skin; cracked lips; bags over as well as under her eyes; and a mop of greying hair that would probably digest any comb that went near it. Whenever she trudges towards her colleagues, they swear under their breath and back away, mainly because she has become such an embarrassing liability, but partly, you assume, because of the stench that clings to her black leather jacket.
        Kidman’s lack of vanity in the role is impressive, but the film’s truly daring aspect is not how badly Erin looks but how badly she behaves. She alienates her colleagues and beats up her contacts, habits which Hollywood movies usually give to wisecracking rebels. But Erin is less of a cool anti-hero than a hot mess. She has ruined her relationship with her ex-husband (Scoot McNairy) and her teenaged daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn); her working relationship with her partner (Shamier Anderson) isn’t much better; and her barely competent police work seems to be motivated not by a thirst for justice or even revenge, but by half-crazed desperation. For a male film star to play such a hopeless case would be brave enough; for a female film star to do so is almost unprecedented. Destroyer isn’t quite as radical as Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, but both films take action-movie archetypes – the maverick cop, the soldier-turned-mercenary – and examine how deeply miserable such a person would be.`,

        newsMenuMoviesArticle: `“Chinese cinema, and the industry of film-making in China is the new way.”

        That’s the opinion of Nicolas Cage, who was speaking to Talking Movies from the Macau International Film Festival in December 2018, while promoting his latest film, Mandy.
        
        At one time, it was only Tom Cruise who could bring an Asian audience to a film; now Hollywood is actively courting the East.
        
        China’s huge audiences have added millions to the box-office takings of recent films like Avengers: Infinity War, Venom and Aquaman, which was released in China before the US. But the Hollywood-backed 2018 hit, Crazy Rich Asians, failed to find audiences in China.
        
        The international film market has grown dramatically in the last 20 years, with around 70% of Hollywood studios’ revenue being generated overseas today – compared with around 30% two decades ago.`,
