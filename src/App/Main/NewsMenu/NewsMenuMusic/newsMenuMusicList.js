        newsMenuMusicArticle: `A new documentary celebrates Ahmad Zahir, the ‘60s and ‘70s icon who mysteriously died in 1979. Arwa Haider talks to the people making the film, including Zahir’s daughter, about how the singer combined popularity with protest.
        There is some dream-like footage online of a 1970s gig at Kabul’s Intercontinental Hotel, showing an energetic figure leading a multi-instrumental band. The performer’s hip looks (dark quiff and sideburns; loosened tie) and rollicking, psych-roots grooves reflect the ‘Afghan Elvis’ nickname he earned.
        This was Ahmad Zahir, pop culture sensation and the son of Afghanistan’s former prime minister: during a booming ‘golden age’ in the ‘60s and ‘70s, he was a prolific recording artist and a music idol for the masses. Zahir’s music drew from Persian poetry as well as Indian classical styles, and it increasingly revealed a political edge, criticising the Soviet-backed Marxist regime who had seized power in Afghanistan following a 1978 military coup.
        On 14 June, 1979, his 33rd birthday, Zahir died in mysterious circumstances (officially a car crash, but some have questioned that). On hearing the news, his pregnant wife Fahira went into premature labour, giving birth to a baby girl, Shabnam. Nearly 40 years later, Shabnam and US film director Sam French are collaborating on a Kickstarter-funded documentary about her father’s life.`,

        newsMenuMusicArticle: `A new play, All You Need is LSD, tracks the importance of psychedelic drugs beyond just flower power. Is it time for a third ‘summer of love’?
        When you think of LSD, a very specific aesthetic probably leaps to mind: the psychedelic pink-and-orange swirls of the 60s; naked people with flowers in their hair; the shimmer of a sitar. After its psychedelic properties were accidentally discovered in the lab by Albert Hofmann in 1943, the drug was banned in the UK in 1966. LSD is still most strongly associated with hippies who embraced its mind-expanding properties.
        In fact, the drug’s after-effects have seeped through much of Western culture, from art to literature to, most obviously, music, which was never the same after Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix dropped acid. Whole genres have since flagged their debt to mind-altering substances: psychedelic rock, psytrance, acid house... the latter hailing from that other spike in psych: 80s and 90s rave culture. Although ecstasy is the drug most associated with the second summer of love, LSD also saw a resurgence in the UK at that time.
        That was 30 years ago. Are we due another psychedelic renaissance? British playwright Leo Butler hopes so. “There was a need – political, socially – for that LSD explosion in the 60s and the ecstasy explosion in the early 90s,” he tells BBC Culture. “You look at the world now and think, god it could really do with a super-strong psychedelic! We need something to bring us together – let’s have a third summer of love.”
        Having experimented with drugs when he was younger, Butler wanted to write an honest view of the psychedelic experience. But he also wanted to acknowledge the influence of LSD beyond just flower power – and his new show All You Need is LSD brings us right up to the present moment.

        In recent years, LSD has undergone something of a public image shift, from Steve Jobs talking about his experiences to Silicon Valley types advocating microdosing (taking tiny amounts of the drug to boost creativity). The first placebo-controlled study into microdosing was launched in September by the Beckley Foundation and Imperial College London, while the UK has also conducted medical trials that investigate LSD’s potential therapeutic uses.

        While it may not quite be a summer of love, it might just be the beginning of a new era of openness, even respectability, for the drug.

        This medical interest even found its way into Butler’s play. In 2015, he interviewed former UK government drugs tsar Professor David Nutt, who mentioned he was about to begin the first medical trial on LSD in 50 years. That Tuesday. Would Butler like to take part?`,

        newsMenuMusicImg: `news-menu-music-img-3`,
        newsMenuMusicArticle: `With previously unpublished photos and archive interviews, a new book – released on what would have been John Lennon’s 78th birthday – tells the inside story of Imagine.
        It is the ultimate peace anthem; an ode to idealism. But Imagine is also a song about love. When it was composed, in 1971, John Lennon and Yoko Ono had been together for three years. She was lambasted by some as the ‘dragon lady’ who had broken up Lennon's marriage to Cynthia – and, in the process, The Beatles. Yet, as a new book from Thames & Hudson suggests, Ono was misrepresented – even when it came to being credited for a song’s creation. In a 1980 interview reprinted in Imagine John Yoko, Lennon admits that Ono was equally responsible for Imagine; in 2017, Ono was formally recognised as co-writer of the iconic song.
        As the book shows, through a collection of rarely seen photos and archive interviews along with insider accounts detailing the making of the album, Lennon and Ono inspired each other from their first meeting.
        In 1966, Lennon went to a preview of Ono’s show at the Indica gallery in London, and wanted to contribute to a piece called Hammer a Nail in. But Ono was reluctant to let him, as she recalls in an archive interview in the book. “I said, ‘All right, if he pays five shillings, it’s okay,’ because I decided that my painting will never sell anyway.”`,

        newsMenuMusicImg: `news-menu-music-img-4`,
        newsMenuMusicArticle: `As new TV series Pose brings drag balls into the mainstream, Arwa Haider looks at how the glamorous underground culture became a big hit.
        “The category is… Live! Work! Pose!” declares charismatic ball emcee Pray Tell (Billy Porter) in the intro to US drama series Pose, which premiered on the FX channel in June. Co-created by Ryan Murphy (Glee, Nip/Tuck, American Horror Story), Pose summons the electrifying energy and fierce style of New York’s real-life black and Latin gay ballroom scene of the 1980s, and contrasts its working-class subcultures with that period’s luxury business world (Trump Tower looms in the background).
        With a second season just announced for 2019, it highlights the continued influence of ‘house’ ball culture: a theme previously explored in Jennie Livingston’s landmark 1991 doc Paris Is Burning, and through musical magpies including Malcolm McLaren (Deep In Vogue) and Madonna’s 1990 megahit Vogue. The original underground moves shook up the mainstream – now they spark fresh expressions, on a broader scale than ever.
        Pose depicts this after-hours party scene, where those excluded from conservative society could express themselves freely, dress fabulously, and find belonging in various family ‘houses’. There is a heady delight in its ball scenes, and a serious respect for ‘realness’, or authenticity. It’s notable for having a cast and crew featuring several trans women, including co-writer/producer/director Jane Mock, and actresses Indya Moore (as Angel Evangelista) and Dominique Jackson (as the formidable house mother Elektra Abundance). Original scene talents, such as Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza (who also danced in Madonna’s Vogue video) cameo as ball judges.`,
