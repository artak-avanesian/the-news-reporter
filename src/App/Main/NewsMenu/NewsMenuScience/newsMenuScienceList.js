        newsMenuScienceTitle: `Climate change: UK carbon capture project begins`,
        newsMenuScienceImg: `news-menu-science-img-1`,
        newsMenuScienceArticle: [
            `The giant Drax power station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, has become the first in Europe to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from wood-burning. Drax burns seven million tonnes of wood chips each year to drive generators to make electricity.`,
            `The firm has now begun a pilot project to capture one tonne a day of CO2 from its wood combustion. The technology effectively turns climate change into reverse on a tiny scale, but it’s controversial.`,
            `How does it reverse climate change?
            When a forest grows, the trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to make their wood.
            If you burn that wood, the process doesn’t emit any extra CO2 into the atmosphere - because the trees removed it from the air in the first place. It’s called carbon neutral.`,
            `If you go one step further by capturing the CO2 from wood burning, you’re actually reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere overall. In an ideal world you’d go one step further by creating useful products from the waste CO2.
            Why is it needed? This technology is known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).`,
            `Many scientists believe it will be needed because they don't trust politicians to curb the CO2 emissions that are over-heating the planet.
            They say that unless carbon emissions start falling dramatically, we will overshoot the recommended safety limit of a 1.5C rise in global temperature.
            Carbon capture sounds smart – why is it controversial?
            There are two main reasons for controversy.`,
            ` First is the impact on the plants and animals living on the huge amount of land needed to grow the trees and plants needed to generate power on a wide scale.
            Second is the amount of additional energy needed to capture and store the carbon.
            Let’s just take the example of Drax.`,
            `The power station generates 6% of the UK’s electricity whilst burning seven million tonnes of wood a year – that’s more wood than is harvested in the whole of Britain. The majority of the supply comes from the US, where forests are expanding as small-scale farmers allow unprofitable land to go back to nature.
            Drax says most of its fuel is residue from forest industries – that’s offcuts and unsuitable trees for timber.`,
            `A previous BBC investigation found that some of the wood almost certainly also comes from species-rich swamp forests in the southern US.
            What if the world wants to generate carbon neutral energy by burning wood?
            This is where the numbers get a bit mind-boggling.
            One estimate suggests that a staggering amount of land would be required to make BECCS feasible under the Paris climate agreement — perhaps as much as three times the area of India.`,
            `Harvard University professor David Keith warned: “We must be cautious of technologies that aim to remediate the carbon problem while greatly expanding our impact on the land.” That impact will depend on many variables, such as whether the wood is so-called “waste”; whether it comes from plantation forests or natural forests; how its removal from the forest reduces the amount of material that will lock up carbon in the soil; how it’s transported – and more.`,

        newsMenuScienceImg: `news-menu-science-img-2`,
        newsMenuScienceArticle: [
            `A study has identified key tree species that are resilient to climate change and support critically endangered apes.
            Planting them could help future proof rainforests, which are a key habitat for orangutans, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.`,
            `Researchers surveyed 250 plants in Indonesia's Kutai National Park.
            Over 1,000 orangutans are thought to inhabit the park, as well as other rare animals such as the Malayan sun bear.`,
            `"Selecting which species to plant is a significant contribution to restoring the health of this ecosystem," said study co-author Douglas Sheil.
            "Of course, the reasons why forest cover was lost in the first place must also be addressed for reforestation efforts to succeed."
            Kutai National Park is located on the east coast of Borneo Island, in the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia.`,
            `The forest faces threats from logging, fires and mining, and was once considered a conservation wasteland.
            Efforts are underway to try to restore the habitat, which is home to more than a thousand plants, 80 mammals and 300 birds, including what is thought to be the largest population of orangutans in the province.`,

        newsMenuScienceImg: `news-menu-science-img-3`,
        newsMenuScienceArticle: [
            `Many garden plants we're familiar with today have a hidden history.
            Grown centuries ago for their reputed healing powers, they became garden staples, valued for their beauty, form or scent.`,
            `Pulmonaria, with its spotted leaves, was thought to symbolise diseased lungs, and used for chest infections. And the mint now found in a pot by the door was recommended to "stayeth bleeding" by early herbalists and apothecaries.`,
            `There's more to garden plants than just their aesthetics, says Fiona Davison, head of libraries and exhibitions at the Royal Horticultural Society, RHS.
            Plants generally don't get into gardens by accident, she says - they have a long relationship with people. "It's been a long story of people choosing particular plants, nurturing them, growing them, breeding them, making choices of which seedling they would select to carry on growing," she says.`,
            `"And a lot of times those choices have been made on aesthetics, but a lot of times those choices have been made on the basis of what they thought the plant would do for you, from a medicinal point of view."
            Studies of plants by ancient herbalists paved the way for the formal study of plants by the first botanists, many of whom were also physicians. Today, at least 28,000 plant species are recorded as being of medicinal use.`,
            `Fiona Davison says the long story of the "healing garden" is coming full circle and we're now thinking of gardens holistically as "healing spaces", where, by spending time in them, we're getting some well-being benefit.
            Here are five garden plants that you can still find in your garden, that were once recommended by ancient herbalists.`,

        newsMenuScienceImg: `news-menu-science-img-4`,
        newsMenuScienceArticle: [
            `The catastrophic collapse of a dam at a mine in Brazil has exposed a darker side of an industry that the world depends on. At nearly 800 sites across the country and thousands more around the world, dams contain huge loads of mining waste.`,
            `One British scientist, Dr Stephen Edwards of UCL, has warned that "we are sitting on a time bomb". He told BBC News that further disasters were inevitable.`,
            `Over the last few days in the heart of Brazil's mining belt, I've been investigating two very different sites where the risks of massive damage seem plausible. One is a vast lake of sludge perched high above a nervous community; the other is an abandoned gold mine at risk of leaking poisons.
            Why are there dumps of mining waste?
            The answer begins with the world's growing demand for metals such as steel which is used to make everything from buildings to ships to cars.`,
            `The key ingredient of steel is iron ore which is extracted from the ground in huge mines - Brazil is one of the world's largest producers. he ore is broken up, and because only a small fraction of the rock is actually iron, the vast majority is unwanted, a by-product that's thrown away.
            And the cheapest way to dispose of these remains is to create what's called a "tailings pond" - a rather genteel term for a dumping-ground sealed with a dam.`,
            `Are these dumps easy to find?
            Not always. The mining companies tend to tuck them away in valleys in the hills. We used satellite mapping to find one of the largest tailings ponds in Brazil, a site called Maravilhas II, owned by the mining giant Vale which also owns the dam that failed last month.`,
            `Stretching as far as the eye can see is what looks like a sea of red mud, streaked with swirls of black and grey, a mass of sludge.`,

        newsMenuScienceArticle: [
            `The UK-assembled rover that will be sent to Mars in 2020 will bear the name of DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin. The honour follows a public call for suggestions that drew nearly 36,000 responses from right across Europe.`,
            `Astronaut Tim Peake unveiled the name at the Airbus factory in Stevenage where the robot is being put together.
            The six-wheeled vehicle will be equipped with instruments and a drill to search for evidence of past or present life on the Red Planet.`,
            `Giving the rover a name associated with a molecule fundamental to biology seems therefore to be wholly appropriate. Rosalind Franklin played an integral role in the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid.`,
            `It was her X-ray images that allowed James Watson and Francis Crick to decipher its double-helix shape. Franklin's early death from ovarian cancer in 1958, aged just 37, meant she never received the recognition given to her male peers.`,
            `The attachment to the European Space Agency (Esa) rover will now see her name travel beyond Earth. "In the last year of Rosalind's life, I remember visiting her in hospital on the day when she was excited by the news of the [Soviet Sputnik satellite] - the very beginning of space exploration," Franklin's sister, Jenifer Glynn, said on Thursday.
            "She could never have imagined that over 60 years later there would be a rover sent to Mars bearing her name, but somehow that makes this project even more special."`,
