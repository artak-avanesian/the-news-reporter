        newsMenuSportsImgSrc: ``,
        newsMenuSportsArticle: `Rohit Sharma became the highest run-scorer in Twenty20 internationals as India beat New Zealand to level the three-match series at 1-1.

        The opener, 31, hit 50 off 29 balls as India chased 159 to win by seven wickets with seven balls to spare in Auckland.
        
        He now has 2,288 runs, surpassing New Zealand's Martin Guptill's 2,272.
        
        Rohit, who made his T20 debut for India against England in 2007, averages 32.68 from 92 matches.
        
        He has scored four centuries and 16 fifties, with a strike-rate of 138.41.
        
        Krunal Pandya took 3-28 to help restrict New Zealand to 158-8, which featured 50 from Colin de Grandhomme, his maiden T20 half-century.
        
        Rohit, stand-in captain for the series as skipper Virat Kohli is being rested, shared an opening stand of 79 with Shikhar Dhawan in India's reply.
        
        Although both fell in quick succession, Rishabh Pant made an unbeaten 40 off 28 balls and MS Dhoni 20 not out to seal a comfortable victory.
        
        "I'm very pleased with how we bowled and then we were quite clinical with the bat as well," said Rohit.
        
        "We were expecting a performance like that. We've got quality in our side but we didn't execute our plans in the first game.
        
        "We learned from our mistakes and we got the reward for it."
        
        India, who won the one-day series 4-1, lost the first T20 by 80 runs, their heaviest defeat in that format.
        
        The final T20 is in Hamilton on Sunday.`,

        newsMenuSportsImgSrc: ``,
        newsMenuSportsArticle: `Legendary baseball Hall of Famer Frank Robinson - the first African-American to manage a professional team - has died aged 83, baseball officials say.

        After winning Most Valuable Player awards in both US leagues - the only player in history to do so - he went on to manage Cleveland in 1975.
        
        With a total of 586, he is 10th on the list of the most home runs hit in a major league career.
        
        Robinson, who holds countless other records, died at home in California.
        
        Since his debut, more than half of all teams have had a black manager.
        
        Crowding the plate
        Born in Beaumont, Texas, in 1935, Robinson got his start in Major League Baseball in 1956 - just nine years after Jackie Robinson broke the colour barrier by joining a professional team.
        
        In his first at-bat for Cleveland he hit a home run.
        
        Over his career, he coached the Baltimore Orioles, the San Francisco Giants and Montreal.
        
        Robinson became the first manager of the Washington Nationals after the team relocated from Montreal for the 2005 season.
        Robinson was known to crowd the plate before the pitch, and famously was hit by the ball 198 times.

        "Pitchers did me a favour when they knocked me down," Robinson said. "It made me more determined. I wouldn't let that pitcher get me out."`,

        newsMenuSportsImgSrc: ``,
        newsMenuSportsArticle: `Greek player Maria Sakkari described the line judges as "the worst I have ever seen in my life" in her Fed Cup defeat by Britain's Johanna Konta.

        The world number 38 said they "were not professional" in a 4-6 6-2 6-3 defeat in Bath that featured a number of questionable calls.
        
        "This is unacceptable. They were making a lot of mistakes," Sakkari said. "We cannot have amateurs."
        
        Konta also complained about several calls, including one on match point.
        
        "I think it was quite tough at both our ends but when it's such a tough match like that - so many heightened emotions - the line judges will feel the same kind of pressure, the same kind of stress," said Konta, whose win over Sakkari sealed victory for Great Britain in the Group A tie.
        
        "Everybody's human, but it was definitely a hard thing to contend with."
        
        The round-robin event - which is being held in Britain for the first time in 26 years - does not have Hawk-Eye technology to review line calls but Konta said "it's the challenge we face" and added it was "the nature of the game".
        
        Lawn Tennis Association tournament director Rebecca James said: "The officials selected for this event by the Association of British Tennis Officials (ABTO) have all worked at the highest levels of the game.
        
        "The chair umpires are internationally certified and selected by the ITF. The lines people are all paid, LTA licensed officials, who have worked Wimbledon semi-finals and finals between them, including many on previous Davis Cup World Group ties."`,

        newsMenuSportsArticle: `Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu says the club's transfer activity is an indication they are preparing for life after Lionel Messi.

        Barca last month confirmed the £65m signing of 21-year-old midfielder Frenkie de Jong from Ajax.
        
        Messi, 31, has scored 581 goals in 664 games for Barcelona.
        
        "I know one day Lionel will say he's retiring," Bartomeu told the 5 live Football Daily Podcast's Guillem Balague.
        
        Messi still has another two years left on his current contract and Bartomeu said that Messi's retirement was "a while away yet".
        
        Listen to Bartomeu interview and BBC experts on the brilliance of Vinicius Junior
        However, the 25-time La Liga champions are looking at signing players to take the club into a new era to ensure their continued success.
        
        "We have to prepare the club for the future," added Bartomeu, who is due to step down as president in 2021.
        
        "We are bringing great young players to the team because we need to continue this era of success. That's our responsibility.
        
        "My mandate will be finished in two seasons. So I need to leave the club in a great position and tell the new president 'that's our legacy'."
        
        In 2017, Messi said he had moved closer to his "dream" of "finishing my career at home" after signing a new Barca deal, with the buyout clause raised to 700m euros (£626m).
        
        He has won nine La Liga titles with Barcelona as well as four Champions League titles and six Copa del Rey's.`,

        After all, why do only one thing when you can do three?
        
        As a pre-schooler, she signed up to a ballet class.
        
        "But then they made it compulsory that you also had to do tap dancing as well, and I was terrible at tap dancing, so I quit that aged four," she explains.
        
        She joined a song-and-dance club instead. That lasted two years before she switched to a weekend drama group.
        
        Then, leaving the boys behind in the playground, she discovered she was fast.
        
        "My mum and I were just googling 'Manchester athletics clubs' - we found one and it said that the practice was on Saturdays," she says.
        
        "That was a clash with drama, so I had the choice: try athletics or stick with drama.
        
        "I quit drama."
        
        Barely a teenager, already a renaissance woman.
        
        Now 20, she is still swapping hats with millennial speed.

        newsMenuSportsImgSrc: ``,
        newsMenuSportsArticle: `Liverpool have announced a world record profit of £106m.

        In their yearly financial results, the Reds made an annual pre-tax profit of £125m - up from £40m - as turnover increased in the 12 months to May 2018 by £90m to £455m, also a record.
        
        Liverpool were boosted financially by a run to the Champions League final last season, which earned an estimated £72m.
        
        They were also helped by midfielder Philippe Coutinho's £142m transfer to Barcelona in January 2018.
        
        Leicester City had held the record for net (post-tax) profit of £80m in 2016-17 (£92m pre-tax) after reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 2017.
        
        Having topped the Premier League table for much of the season, Liverpool are vying with defending champions Manchester City for a first English top-flight title for 29 years, and that success has been mirrored off the pitch too.
        
        Media revenue has increased by £66m to £220m, commercial revenue by £17m to £154m and match revenue by £7m to £81m.
        
        In revenue terms, Liverpool will leapfrog Arsenal into third place in the Premier League, behind Manchester United and Manchester City.
        
        In total, £137m came into the club from player transfers. Liverpool say all of that has been reinvested back into the squad, taking outgoings on new players to more than £190m.
        
        Andy Hughes, the club's chief operating officer, said: "What we have seen is a stable and sustained improvement in the club's financial position over recent years.
        
        "This growth and increase in revenue has enabled us to significantly reinvest both in the playing squad and the football operational infrastructure.
        
        "Financial results do fluctuate depending on player trading costs and timing of payments, but what's clear in these latest results is the further strengthening of our underlying financial footing and profits being reinvested in the squad and infrastructure."
        
        The club also say their social media platforms had a 14% growth rate, taking the total to over 60 million followers across digital channels, and that in May 2018 they had the highest viewing figures ever for a Premier League club, and third of any sports club globally.`,
