Its glittering retinue of Hollywood stars told the story of Perseus, the demigod from Greek mythology who kills a sea monster and saves the beautiful princess Andromeda from being said monster’s lunch. Such was the film’s popularity that it was remade in 2010; the film managed a rather disparaging 26% on the Rotten Tomatoes site. How many of those rating the film had a classical education is unclear, but perhaps it would have performed better had its producers done their research. As according to British art historian Elizabeth McGrath’s 1992 article The Black Andromeda, Andromeda was, indeed, originally depicted as a black princess from Ethiopia.`,\r\n\r\n            `Anyone who watched either of the two Clash of the Titans films will know that Judi Bowker and Alexa Devalos are both white women, and anyone who has seen Andromeda in a painting – perhaps Titian’s or Poynter’s – will believe she is white too. But McGrath’s article was definitive in addressing three things: that all the Greek mythographers placed Andromeda as a princess of Ethiopia, that Ovid specifically refers to her dark skin and that artists throughout Western art history frequently omitted to depict her blackness because Andromeda was supposed to be beautiful, and blackness and beauty – for many of them – was dichotomous. There is no doubt about Andromena’s race, according to Professor McGrath.`,\r\n\r\n            `Yet Renaissance art repeatedly depicts Andromeda as white. In Piero di Cosimo’s Perseus Freeing Andromeda from the 1510s she is actually whiter than all the figures around her, including a black musician and her parents, who are considerably darker and in exotic costume. We do know that there was active debate about her skin colour, a debate that would certainly seem racist to modern eyes. McGrath references Francisco Pacheco, a Spanish artist and writer, who asks in one passage of his book Arte de la Pintura why Andromeda is so often painted as white-skinned when several of the sources say she is black. `,\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        newsMenuCultureId: `newsMenuCulture-2`,\r\n        newsMenuCultureTitle: `Rita: How the hit Danish dramedy went global`,\r\n        newsMenuCultureImg: `news-menu-culture-img-2`,\r\n        newsMenuCultureArticle: [\r\n            `When Danish teacher Rita returns from a suspension from her job, she finds that her school has merged with another – and that her mug is missing from the staff room.

Here, though, a thing of beauty was indeed a joy forever. Serene, symmetrical, laced with subtle religious symbolism – its plan a cross set within a square within an imaginary circle – and with classical Ionic porticos facing all four cardinal points of the compass, this exquisite house connected landscape to city while fusing art to architecture. Here was a Renaissance ideal made perfectly real.`,\r\n            `Ever since, and in no matter what style, material or culture, certain architects and enlightened or excitable patrons have aimed to do more or less what Palladio and Almerico did 450 years ago.

It also looks at the work of artists who have made the house a focus of their creativity, and by implication it raises the question admirably answered by Palladio and Paulo Almerico: can the house be a work of art?`,\r\n            `The question is timely given that the problem of housing the world’s rapidly growing population has led to intense suburban sprawl along with the spread of shantytowns – not to mention homes and houses, whether cheap or costly, that are as far from art as the hillside favelas of Rio de Janeiro are from the salubriously populated slopes of Vicenza.`\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport const getNewsMenuCultureMap = (array) => {\r\n    return array.reduce((map, article) => ({\r\n        ...map,\r\n        [article.newsMenuCultureId]: article\r\n    }), {})\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default newsMenuCultureList","import React from 'react'\r\nimport './NewsMenuCultureArticle.css'\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom'\r\n\r\nconst NewsMenuCultureArticle = ({\r\n    newsMenuCultureTitle,\r\n    newsMenuCultureImg,\r\n    newsMenuCultureId\r\n}) => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <article className='news-menu-culture-article'>\r\n            <div className={newsMenuCultureImg}></div>\r\n            <Link to={`/news-menu/culture/${newsMenuCultureId}`}>\r\n                <h5>{newsMenuCultureTitle}</h5>\r\n            </Link>\r\n        </article>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n//some css properties locate in NewsMenuWorldNewsArticle.css\r\n\r\nexport default NewsMenuCultureArticle","import React from 'react'\r\nimport newsMenuCultureList from './newsMenuCultureList'\r\nimport NewsMenuCultureArticle from './NewsMenuCultureArticle/NewsMenuCultureArticle'\r\n\r\nconst NewsMenuCulture = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='news-menu-culture-articles'>\r\n            {\r\n                newsMenuCultureList.map(({\r\n                    newsMenuCultureTitle,\r\n                    newsMenuCultureId,\r\n                    newsMenuCultureImg\r\n                }) => (\r\n                    <React.Fragment key={newsMenuCultureId}>\r\n                        <NewsMenuCultureArticle\r\n                            newsMenuCultureTitle={newsMenuCultureTitle}\r\n                            newsMenuCultureImg={newsMenuCultureImg}\r\n                            newsMenuCultureId={newsMenuCultureId}\r\n                        />\r\n                    </React.Fragment>\r\n                ))\r\n            }\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default NewsMenuCulture","const newsMenuMusicList = [\r\n    {\r\n        newsMenuMusicId: `newsMenuMusic-1`,\r\n        newsMenuMusicTitle: `Ahmad Zahir: The enduring appeal of the Afghan Elvis`,\r\n        newsMenuMusicImg: `news-menu-music-img-1`,\r\n        newsMenuMusicArticle: [\r\n            `A new documentary celebrates Ahmad Zahir, the ‘60s and ‘70s icon who mysteriously died in 1979.

After its psychedelic properties were accidentally discovered in the lab by Albert Hofmann in 1943, the drug was banned in the UK in 1966. LSD is still most strongly associated with hippies who embraced its mind-expanding properties.`,\r\n            `In fact, the drug’s after-effects have seeped through much of Western culture, from art to literature to, most obviously, music, which was never the same after Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix dropped acid. Whole genres have since flagged their debt to mind-altering substances: psychedelic rock, psytrance, acid house... the latter hailing from that other spike in psych: 80s and 90s rave culture. Although ecstasy is the drug most associated with the second summer of love, LSD also saw a resurgence in the UK at that time.`,\r\n            `That was 30 years ago. Are we due another psychedelic renaissance? British playwright Leo Butler hopes so. “There was a need – political, socially – for that LSD explosion in the 60s and the ecstasy explosion in the early 90s,” he tells BBC Culture. “You look at the world now and think, god it could really do with a super-strong psychedelic! We need something to bring us together – let’s have a third summer of love.”`,\r\n            `Having experimented with drugs when he was younger, Butler wanted to write an honest view of the psychedelic experience. But he also wanted to acknowledge the influence of LSD beyond just flower power – and his new show All You Need is LSD brings us right up to the present moment.`,\r\n            `In recent years, LSD has undergone something of a public image shift, from Steve Jobs talking about his experiences to Silicon Valley types advocating microdosing (taking tiny amounts of the drug to boost creativity). The first placebo-controlled study into microdosing was launched in September by the Beckley Foundation and Imperial College London, while the UK has also conducted medical trials that investigate LSD’s potential therapeutic uses.`,\r\n            `While it may not quite be a summer of love, it might just be the beginning of a new era of openness, even respectability, for the drug.\r\n            This medical interest even found its way into Butler’s play. In 2015, he interviewed former UK government drugs tsar Professor David Nutt, who mentioned he was about to begin the first medical trial on LSD in 50 years. That Tuesday.

She was lambasted by some as the ‘dragon lady’ who had broken up Lennon's marriage to Cynthia – and, in the process, The Beatles. Yet, as a new book from Thames & Hudson suggests, Ono was misrepresented – even when it came to being credited for a song’s creation. In a 1980 interview reprinted in Imagine John Yoko, Lennon admits that Ono was equally responsible for Imagine; in 2017, Ono was formally recognised as co-writer of the iconic song.`,\r\n            `As the book shows, through a collection of rarely seen photos and archive interviews along with insider accounts detailing the making of the album, Lennon and Ono inspired each other from their first meeting.`,\r\n           `In 1966, Lennon went to a preview of Ono’s show at the Indica gallery in London, and wanted to contribute to a piece called Hammer a Nail in. But Ono was reluctant to let him, as she recalls in an archive interview in the book. “I said, ‘All right, if he pays five shillings, it’s okay,’ because I decided that my painting will never sell anyway.”`,\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        newsMenuMusicId: `newsMenuMusic-4`,\r\n        newsMenuMusicTitle: `How drag balls went mainstream`,\r\n        newsMenuMusicImg: `news-menu-music-img-4`,\r\n        newsMenuMusicArticle: [\r\n            `As new TV series Pose brings drag balls into the mainstream, Arwa Haider looks at how the glamorous underground culture became a big hit.`,\r\n            `“The category is… Live! Work! Pose!” declares charismatic ball emcee Pray Tell (Billy Porter) in the intro to US drama series Pose, which premiered on the FX channel in June.

The original underground moves shook up the mainstream – now they spark fresh expressions, on a broader scale than ever.`,\r\n           `Pose depicts this after-hours party scene, where those excluded from conservative society could express themselves freely, dress fabulously, and find belonging in various family ‘houses’. There is a heady delight in its ball scenes, and a serious respect for ‘realness’, or authenticity. It’s notable for having a cast and crew featuring several trans women, including co-writer/producer/director Jane Mock, and actresses Indya Moore (as Angel Evangelista) and Dominique Jackson (as the formidable house mother Elektra Abundance).

Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the best cartoon of 2014 was such a magnificently animated and dazzlingly inventive delight that there was probably only one way its follow-up could go. But it is still depressing to see The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part falling so far short of its glorious predecessor.`, \r\n            `One obvious reason for the shortfall is that the first film caught everyone unawares. Those of us who walked into the cinema fearing a cynical advert for a Danish construction toy brand found ourselves gawping instead at a daring Orwellian satire, the exhilarating and hilarious adventure of a cheerfully conformist construction worker, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who learns that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue every one of Bricksburg’s Lego citizens into place.`,\r\n            `The second shock came when The Lego Movie threw in characters from different franchises – not just the scene-stealingly sullen Batman (Will Arnett), but Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, C-3PO from Star Wars and more. And the third shock was that, as well as being a cartoon set in a land where everyone and everything is made of brightly coloured modular plastic, The Lego Movie was revealed at the end to be the story of a boy (Jadon Sand) named Finn, who is shown in a couple of live-action sequences arguing with his father (Will Ferrell, again) about whether Lego should be played with or collected.`,\r\n            `The sequel lacks these numerous elements of surprise. A second time around, it is no longer a novelty to see characters from separate fictional universes bumping into each other; only a figurine representing a certain US Supreme Court justice is incongruous enough to raise a smile. Moreover, we know from the start that Emmet’s exploits are really just Finn’s games. The last film finished with Bricksburg being invaded by his little sister’s toddler-friendly Duplo bricks, and the new film picks up from there, so it’s clear that whatever happens in the Lego-verse is nothing more than a squabble between a teenage boy and a pre-teen girl.`,\r\n            `The siblings’ main disagreement concerns whether their games should be gritty or glittery. Five years on from the Duplo invasion, Bricksburg has been reduced to a dystopian desert where the Lego characters divide their time between fighting for survival and gazing moodily into the distance. Only Emmet remains as chirpy as ever. This opening sequence is both a parody of Mad Max and a comment on the adolescent conviction that stories set in post-apocalyptic wastelands are “cooler and more mature” than those which aren’t.`,\r\n            `But the film doesn’t stay in this setting for long. A generic alien whisks Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a few of her friends off to another galaxy, and Emmett chases after them with the help of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), a hard-bitten, perma-stubbled hunk with a fist-shaped spacecraft and a crew of talking velociraptors.`,\r\n            `As frenetic and fun as these escapades are, the crux of the plot is that an alien queen (Tiffany Haddish) wants to marry Batman, and Batman’s pals don’t want her to because... well, just because. To put it another way, in The Lego Movie our heroes were trying to save civilisation as they knew it. In the sequel, they are trying to stop a wedding. It’s not the same, is it? The conflict makes sense in the live-action world of Finn and his sister: he wants their Lego play sessions to be grim and action-packed, whereas she wants them to be about wedding preparations. But in the cartoon world of Emmet and Wyldstyle, it isn’t too exciting.`\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        newsMenuMoviesId: `newsMenuMovies-2`,\r\n        newsMenuMoviesTitle: `Academy Adwards 2019: How good are the best picture nominees?`,\r\n        newsMenuMoviesImg: `news-menu-movies-img-2`,\r\n        newsMenuMoviesArticle: [\r\n            `Black Panther`,\r\n            `The first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture was also the biggest film of 2018 at the US box office – and was praised by Barber for having a “radical vision in mind – more radical, indeed, than that of any previous Hollywood studio blockbuster”.

Kidman plays LAPD detective Erin Bell, a name which makes her sound like a Disney character, when she is actually the exact opposite. A gaunt, alcoholic wreck who tends to sleep either in a bar or in her car, Erin has papery, liver-spotted skin; cracked lips; bags over as well as under her eyes; and a mop of greying hair that would probably digest any comb that went near it. Whenever she trudges towards her colleagues, they swear under their breath and back away, mainly because she has become such an embarrassing liability, but partly, you assume, because of the stench that clings to her black leather jacket.`,\r\n            `Kidman’s lack of vanity in the role is impressive, but the film’s truly daring aspect is not how badly Erin looks but how badly she behaves. She alienates her colleagues and beats up her contacts, habits which Hollywood movies usually give to wisecracking rebels. But Erin is less of a cool anti-hero than a hot mess. She has ruined her relationship with her ex-husband (Scoot McNairy) and her teenaged daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn); her working relationship with her partner (Shamier Anderson) isn’t much better; and her barely competent police work seems to be motivated not by a thirst for justice or even revenge, but by half-crazed desperation. For a male film star to play such a hopeless case would be brave enough; for a female film star to do so is almost unprecedented.`,\r\n            `Destroyer isn’t quite as radical as Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, but both films take action-movie archetypes – the maverick cop, the soldier-turned-mercenary – and examine how deeply miserable such a person would be.`,\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        newsMenuMoviesId: `newsMenuMovies-6`,\r\n        newsMenuMoviesTitle: `'Film-making in China is the new way'`,\r\n        newsMenuMoviesImg: `news-menu-movies-img-6`,\r\n        newsMenuMoviesArticle: [\r\n            `“Chinese cinema, and the industry of film-making in China is the new way.”`,\r\n            `That’s the opinion of Nicolas Cage, who was speaking to Talking Movies from the Macau International Film Festival in December 2018, while promoting his latest film, Mandy.`,\r\n            `At one time, it was only Tom Cruise who could bring an Asian audience to a film; now Hollywood is actively courting the East.`,\r\n            `China’s huge audiences have added millions to the box-office takings of recent films like Avengers: Infinity War, Venom and Aquaman, which was released in China before the US.

Friends believe his fantasy could never have coped with the reality. Regular trips to the theatre, ballet and concerts were instrumental in turning him into a cultural omnivore, a tendency which expanded even further once he entered Harvard after World War Two.`,\r\n            `Here his social circle revolved around what Mark Dery, author of Gorey’s first major biography Born to be Posthumous, refers to as the “gay literati”, including the poet Frank O’Hara with whom he shared a passion for obscure literature. Although most people who met him assumed Gorey was also gay, he was notoriously reticent on the subject. When one interviewer pressed him on his sex life, “he responded: ‘I’m a person first, an artist a distant second and whatever else last,’” says Dery.`,\r\n            `There is certainly an undercurrent of homoeroticism, gender fluidity and same-sex couplings running throughout Gorey’s oeuvre and he noted in a letter to a friend that ‘les boys’, as he phrased it, appeared to be among the first to appreciate his unusual works.`,\r\n            `Gorey’s unique style first came to public notice as a designer of paperback covers for Doubleday’s Anchor Books imprint. His elegantly elongated figures and sombre palette, inspired both by the English illustrator Edward Ardizzone and the Japanese Ukiyo-e prints he loved, were in marked contrast to the pulp fiction-inspired covers prevalent at the time.`,\r\n            `The Anchor job meant a move to New York, which did not enthuse him, but opened up a whole new world of cultural possibilities. At the silent film evenings run by the film historian William K Everson, he discovered the work of French film-maker Louis Feuillade. His gothic-macabre crime thrillers Fantômas and Les Vampires would become “the greatest influence on my work. Period,” Gorey later said.

Drax burns seven million tonnes of wood chips each year to drive generators to make electricity.`,\r\n            `The firm has now begun a pilot project to capture one tonne a day of CO2 from its wood combustion. The technology effectively turns climate change into reverse on a tiny scale, but it’s controversial.`,\r\n            `How does it reverse climate change?\r\n            When a forest grows, the trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to make their wood.\r\n            If you burn that wood, the process doesn’t emit any extra CO2 into the atmosphere - because the trees removed it from the air in the first place. It’s called carbon neutral.`,\r\n            `If you go one step further by capturing the CO2 from wood burning, you’re actually reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere overall. In an ideal world you’d go one step further by creating useful products from the waste CO2.\r\n            Why is it needed? This technology is known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).`,\r\n            `Many scientists believe it will be needed because they don't trust politicians to curb the CO2 emissions that are over-heating the planet.\r\n            They say that unless carbon emissions start falling dramatically, we will overshoot the recommended safety limit of a 1.5C rise in global temperature.\r\n            Carbon capture sounds smart – why is it controversial?\r\n            There are two main reasons for controversy.`,\r\n            ` First is the impact on the plants and animals living on the huge amount of land needed to grow the trees and plants needed to generate power on a wide scale.\r\n            Second is the amount of additional energy needed to capture and store the carbon.\r\n            Let’s just take the example of Drax.`,\r\n            `The power station generates 6% of the UK’s electricity whilst burning seven million tonnes of wood a year – that’s more wood than is harvested in the whole of Britain. The majority of the supply comes from the US, where forests are expanding as small-scale farmers allow unprofitable land to go back to nature.\r\n            Drax says most of its fuel is residue from forest industries – that’s offcuts and unsuitable trees for timber.`,\r\n            `A previous BBC investigation found that some of the wood almost certainly also comes from species-rich swamp forests in the southern US.\r\n            What if the world wants to generate carbon neutral energy by burning wood?\r\n            This is where the numbers get a bit mind-boggling.\r\n            One estimate suggests that a staggering amount of land would be required to make BECCS feasible under the Paris climate agreement — perhaps as much as three times the area of India.`,\r\n            `Harvard University professor David Keith warned: “We must be cautious of technologies that aim to remediate the carbon problem while greatly expanding our impact on the land.” That impact will depend on many variables, such as whether the wood is so-called “waste”; whether it comes from plantation forests or natural forests; how its removal from the forest reduces the amount of material that will lock up carbon in the soil; how it’s transported – and more.`,\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        newsMenuScienceId: `newsMenuScience-2`,\r\n        newsMenuScienceTitle: `Climate change: 'Future proofing' forests to protect orangutans`,\r\n        newsMenuScienceImg: `news-menu-science-img-2`,\r\n        newsMenuScienceArticle: [\r\n            `A study has identified key tree species that are resilient to climate change and support critically endangered apes.\r\n            Planting them could help future proof rainforests, which are a key habitat for orangutans, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.`,\r\n            `Researchers surveyed 250 plants in Indonesia's Kutai National Park.\r\n            Over 1,000 orangutans are thought to inhabit the park, as well as other rare animals such as the Malayan sun bear.`,\r\n            `\"Selecting which species to plant is a significant contribution to restoring the health of this ecosystem,\" said study co-author Douglas Sheil.\r\n            \"Of course, the reasons why forest cover was lost in the first place must also be addressed for reforestation efforts to succeed.\"\r\n            Kutai National Park is located on the east coast of Borneo Island, in the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia.`,\r\n            `The forest faces threats from logging, fires and mining, and was once considered a conservation wasteland.\r\n            Efforts are underway to try to restore the habitat, which is home to more than a thousand plants, 80 mammals and 300 birds, including what is thought to be the largest population of orangutans in the province.`,\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        newsMenuScienceId: `newsMenuScience-3`,\r\n        newsMenuScienceTitle: `Herbal history: Five garden plants with a hidden past`,\r\n        newsMenuScienceImg: `news-menu-science-img-3`,\r\n        newsMenuScienceArticle: [\r\n            `Many garden plants we're familiar with today have a hidden history.\r\n            Grown centuries ago for their reputed healing powers, they became garden staples, valued for their beauty, form or scent.`,\r\n            `Pulmonaria, with its spotted leaves, was thought to symbolise diseased lungs, and used for chest infections.

TNR is sometimes referred to as TNR/U.S. to distinguish the American channel from its international sister network, TNR International.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                As of August 2010, TNR is available in over 100 million U.S. households. Broadcast coverage of the U.S. channel extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms, as well as carriage on subscription providers throughout Canada. As of July 2015, TNR is available to about 96,374,000 pay-television households (82.8% of households with at least one television set) in the United States. Globally, TNR programming airs through TNR International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default AboutUs","import React from 'react'\r\nimport './ContactUs.css'\r\n\r\nconst ContactUs = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='contact-us'>\r\n            <h1>Editorial contacts \"The News Reporter\"</h1>\r\n            <p>For subscription, please call 1-(212) 206-66-40 or email subscribe@tnr.us.</p>\r\n            <p>Online Marketing Manager (website editors)</p>\r\n            <p>1-(212)-123 45 67</p>\r\n            <p>In. 7158</p>\r\n            <p>Kate</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ContactUs","import React from 'react'\r\nimport './Subscribe.css'\r\n\r\nconst Subscribe = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='subscribe'>\r\n            <h1>Subscribe to the newspaper \"The News Reporter\"</h1>\r\n            <h2>The News Reporter.

US President Donald Trump said the full report on the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Hashoggi will be published on November 20. The words of Trump were transmitted by journalists from the White House press pool, who accompanied him during his trip to California, where fires broke out. Trump emphasized that the report will identify those who killed the journalist. \"There was a terrible thing - the murder of a journalist. We will have a full report within the next two days, possibly on Monday or Tuesday, \"the head of state said. Later, the US president clarified that it was going to be on Tuesday. Trump also confirmed that he had a telephone conversation with Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Gina Hespel on Saturday on his aircraft. He added that the information that appeared on the CIA on Friday in the media was \"preliminary\". \"They (CIA) have not yet determined anything. It's too early, \"he explained. As it was reported, 59-year-old Hashoggi was killed on October 2 at the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, when he went there to pick up the documents required for the future wedding. His bride was not allowed to enter the institution and after five hours of waiting she was informed that Hashoggi had already left the consulate. The journalist had long ties to the royal family of Saudi Arabia, but he critically wrote about the current government and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In Turkey, they suspect that her husband was questioned, tortured, and then killed and dismembered. For this purpose, 15 officers of the Saudi security services flew to Istanbul on that day. The investigation has sound recordings. After several weeks of objections and under heavy pressure from the West, the Saudi authorities still admitted that the journalist was killed in their consulate. Subsequently, the Turkish authorities reported that, a few days after the assassination of Hashoggi, Saudi Arabia sent a group of 11 experts to Turkey, including a chemist and a toxicologist who had to \"cover the traces\" of the crime.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id:\"world-news-article-2\",\r\n        title:\"California in the fire: a powerful fire destroys forests, houses and cars\",\r\n        img: 'fav-world-news-img-2',\r\n        link: '/world-news-articles/world-news-article-2',\r\n        description:\"Several people were injured in the fire.

If you are familiar with this junction you would know it is far from the US’ current coastline. But in Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel New York 2140, Manhattan is flooded after unabated climate change causes the sea level to rise by 50ft (15.25m). The amphibian city is now a SuperVenice, a grid of canals populated by vaporettos where characters must learn how to deal with a world both familiar and unrecognisable to us. Mid-Manhattan skimboading is all too possible in this future.\r\n        Robinson’s 2017 climate-fiction novel belongs to a growing cadre of works about drowned nations, wind farm utopias or scarred metropolises decades into the future. As diplomats draft the rulebook for the global response to the climate crisis and engineers race to produce better solar panels, writers have found their role, too: telling what Robinson calls “the story of the next century”. In doing that, they might be helping readers across the world comprehend the situation in which we currently find ourselves.  \r\n        Climate change is a notoriously elusive crisis to make sense of, particularly compared to other human-impact catastrophes. Drop some toxic chemicals in a river now and you will see dead fish within days, but what do you witness when you release carbon dioxide? And while, in 2018, a report by UN climate scientists stated that we are heading towards a catastrophe, who can truly imagine what that looks like?\r\n        This is where fiction comes in: it brings the abstract data closer to home by focusing on the faces and stories in these futures. Show readers a detailed and textured account of a climate-changed future, says Robinson, and they have an easier time imagining it. It feels real: characters in these novels worry about the welfare of their children, meddle in extra-marital affairs and grapple with train schedules, just as readers would on their daily lives.\r\n        Abstract futures\r\n        “Science fiction gets people thinking in a way that another report on climate change doesn’t,” says Shelley Streeby, a Professor of Literature and Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego. “It helps people feel about what might be coming, but also about the present.”\r\n        The numbers for climate fiction, or cli-fi as some people call it, are hard to pinpoint – but they are growing fast. A 2016 review tallied 50 novels dealing specifically with man-made climate change and its effects, with 20 appearing in the previous five years, although this number includes all types of novels. That includes John Lanchester’s new environmental fable, The Wall, which has been described as “disquieting and quite good fun at the same time”.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuBooks-3`,\r\n        title: `The library of forbidden books`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        img: `news-menu-books-img-3`,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/books/newsMenuBooks-3',\r\n        article: `“The literature… mainly consists of books that were published long before 1933 but then became a thorn in the Nazis’ side for different reasons,” says Gerhard Stumpf, librarian at the University of Augsburg. “Most of them were Jewish authors – others were socialist or Communist authors – and also anti-war authors who experienced the pain of World War One.”\r\n        From 1976 until his death in 2013, Georg P Salzmann collected about 12,000 books that had been banned – and burnt – by the Nazis for being ‘un-German’.

Drawing on sources as varied as the novels of Agatha Christie and French silent film, he created a uniquely macabre vision of the world filled with crumbling English mansions, jittery dark-eyed flappers and stony faced Edwardian gents where nothing is quite as it seems. His virtuosic illustrations and poetic texts have drawn comparisons to Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear and Samuel Beckett, winning him critical acclaim and a devoted cult following in his native US. Lemony Snicket. Gorey himself was a complicated, reclusive individual whose mission in life was “to make everybody as uneasy as possible”. He collected daguerreotypes of dead babies and lived alone with 20,000 books and six cats in his New York apartment. Sporting an Edwardian beard, he would frequently traipse around the city in a full-length fur coat accessorised with trainers and jangling bracelets.\r\n        A precociously gifted child, he grew up in depression-era Chicago, learning to draw at the age of one-and-a-half and teaching himself to read at three. He had devoured Dracula by the age of five and the complete works of Victor Hugo before he was eight, absorbing a gothic sensibility which would later imprint itself on his work.\r\n        A mystery wrapped in an enigma\r\n        The country house murder mysteries of favourites such as Christie and Dorothy L Sayers nurtured his Anglophilia – although he never actually visited England. Friends believe his fantasy could never have coped with the reality. Regular trips to the theatre, ballet and concerts were instrumental in turning him into a cultural omnivore, a tendency which expanded even further once he entered Harvard after World War Two.\r\n        Here his social circle revolved around what Mark Dery, author of Gorey’s first major biography Born to be Posthumous, refers to as the “gay literati”, including the poet Frank O’Hara with whom he shared a passion for obscure literature. Although most people who met him assumed Gorey was also gay, he was notoriously reticent on the subject. When one interviewer pressed him on his sex life, “he responded: ‘I’m a person first, an artist a distant second and whatever else last,’” says Dery.\r\n        There is certainly an undercurrent of homoeroticism, gender fluidity and same-sex couplings running throughout Gorey’s oeuvre and he noted in a letter to a friend that ‘les boys’, as he phrased it, appeared to be among the first to appreciate his unusual works.\r\n        Gorey’s unique style first came to public notice as a designer of paperback covers for Doubleday’s Anchor Books imprint. His elegantly elongated figures and sombre palette, inspired both by the English illustrator Edward Ardizzone and the Japanese Ukiyo-e prints he loved, were in marked contrast to the pulp fiction-inspired covers prevalent at the time.\r\n        The Anchor job meant a move to New York, which did not enthuse him, but opened up a whole new world of cultural possibilities. At the silent film evenings run by the film historian William K Everson, he discovered the work of French film-maker Louis Feuillade. His gothic-macabre crime thrillers Fantômas and Les Vampires would become “the greatest influence on my work. Period,” Gorey later said. The potted palms, pattern-on-pattern decor in interior sets and mysteriously veiled women in dark clothes who populated his films would become instantly recognisable Gorey motifs.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuBooks-5`,\r\n        title: `The secrets of real-life Lady Chatterley`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/books/newsMenuBooks-5',\r\n        img: `news-menu-books-img-5`,\r\n        article: `A new novel imagines the life of Frieda von Richthofen, the inspiration for many of DH Lawrence’s female characters. Hephzibah Anderson looks at the fate of the literary muse. As job descriptions go, few seem to fit the ‘nice work if you can get it’ category more snugly than ‘muse’. Inspiring lasting works of art by simply existing? It’s at once indolent and noble, evocative of days spent lounging on a chaise longue and nights filled with dance and glittering conversation.\r\n        A look at the life of Frieda von Richthofen might leave you feeling rather differently. She was the inspiration – and model – for many of DH Lawrence’s female characters, including his most scandalous, Lady Chatterley. Yet muse, as she lived it, was a far from undemanding role, encompassing everything from lover and confidante to punch bag. At least, that’s the way Annabel Abbs tells it in a new novel based on her life, titled simply Frieda.\r\n        The daughter of a penniless German baron with a roving eye, Frieda craves adventure and intellectual stimulation. Marriage is all that’s available to her and so, in 1899, aged just 20, she weds British philologist Ernest Weekley. They make their home in Nottingham, back then a heavily industrial town whose factories are a chorus of “clanging and clacking, hissing and spitting”, and in whose air particles of soot hover “like swarms of aphids”.\r\n        In Abbs' novel, Weekley turns out to be the kind of chap who’s far happier thinking about his “snowflower” in absentia, as an ideal, than having to engage with the desires and frustrations of a real woman. While he toils over his seminal book, she has three children, the eldest of whom is seven when she begins to feel something stirring within her. She calls it “the what-I-could-be”.\r\n        Her fickle sister suggests a tonic: infidelity. And as history shows, it was through Else von Richthofen that Frieda met maverick psychoanalyst Otto Gross, who did indeed become her lover, though the affair doesn't cure her of her restlessness. Then Mr Lawrence comes to lunch. A scrawny, gifted miner’s son six years her junior, he’s her husband’s former student.

Its glittering retinue of Hollywood stars told the story of Perseus, the demigod from Greek mythology who kills a sea monster and saves the beautiful princess Andromeda from being said monster’s lunch. Such was the film’s popularity that it was remade in 2010; the film managed a rather disparaging 26% on the Rotten Tomatoes site. How many of those rating the film had a classical education is unclear, but perhaps it would have performed better had its producers done their research. As according to British art historian Elizabeth McGrath’s 1992 article The Black Andromeda, Andromeda was, indeed, originally depicted as a black princess from Ethiopia.\r\n        Anyone who watched either of the two Clash of the Titans films will know that Judi Bowker and Alexa Devalos are both white women, and anyone who has seen Andromeda in a painting – perhaps Titian’s or Poynter’s – will believe she is white too. But McGrath’s article was definitive in addressing three things: that all the Greek mythographers placed Andromeda as a princess of Ethiopia, that Ovid specifically refers to her dark skin and that artists throughout Western art history frequently omitted to depict her blackness because Andromeda was supposed to be beautiful, and blackness and beauty – for many of them – was dichotomous. There is no doubt about Andromena’s race, according to Professor McGrath.\r\n        Yet Renaissance art repeatedly depicts Andromeda as white. In Piero di Cosimo’s Perseus Freeing Andromeda from the 1510s she is actually whiter than all the figures around her, including a black musician and her parents, who are considerably darker and in exotic costume. We do know that there was active debate about her skin colour, a debate that would certainly seem racist to modern eyes. McGrath references Francisco Pacheco, a Spanish artist and writer, who asks in one passage of his book Arte de la Pintura why Andromeda is so often painted as white-skinned when several of the sources say she is black. `,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuCulture-2`,\r\n        title: `Rita: How the hit Danish dramedy went global`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/culture/newsMenuCulture-2',\r\n        img: `news-menu-culture-img-2`,\r\n        article: `When Danish teacher Rita returns from a suspension from her job, she finds that her school has merged with another – and that her mug is missing from the staff room.

Everyone who’d seen her in Tess of the Storm Country (1914) or Rags (1915) knew exactly how she looked – long ringlets, childish dresses, the image of innocence – and they froze her like that forever. The curls cost $50 each, a fortune when a movie ticket was just over a nickel, and Pickford travelled with a suitcase of them.\r\n        The hair belonged to her, but she belonged to everyone. Strangers stole the flowers from her hat and got upset if she ran around barefoot on film. When a child spotted America’s Sweetheart with a manicure – ”Mama! She’s not a real little girl! She has long fingernails!” – Pickford clipped them short and banned herself from fiddling with lipsticks and pencils in public in case someone mistakenly thought she smoked.

Thinking about the way my grandparents were, and the traditional way of Japanese life, I thought we could stop and look around and accept the things that we don’t normally appreciate, like getting older.”\r\n        Calmness seeps through many of the phrases, whether it’s derived from accepting elements beyond our control or being respectful in all our encounters. South African artist David Buchler – who has written short essays for the book – has lived in Japan for seven years. “When I speak to people in Japanese, I’m very aware of what I’m saying and my gestures and being polite, thinking about how my words would affect them,” he tells BBC Culture. “It’s a very different approach to talking.”\r\n        The book covers vast topics including ‘harmony’, ‘gratitude’ and ‘time’ – but it isn’t an abstract dictionary. Instead, Fujimoto offers a way into a culture that can often seem remote to foreigners. So, for Shibui, which “recalls the beauty revealed by the passage of time”, she writes: “Inhering in an aesthetic of calm – colours subdued and brightness muted – this word reminds us to appreciate the things that improve with age. There is a grace in maturity, and the experiences of life mark their objects with a pleasant richness. You might experience shibui in the colour of leaves in early winter, or an old teacup on a table.”\r\n        It’s a philosophy finding a receptive audience: by teaching us to find joy in the objects we own, Japanese tidying guru Marie Kondo has become a Netflix hit and a lifestyle brand, having a knock-on effect on charity shops; while the 21st-Century mindfulness movement offers bite-sized meditations to practise when we’re on our way to work, cooking our dinner, or wandering around a supermarket.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuCulture-6`,\r\n        title: `The world's most beautiful house?`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/culture/newsMenuCulture-6',\r\n        img: `news-menu-culture-img-6`,\r\n        article: `In 1565, Paolo Almerico, a high-ranking official in the Papal courts of Pius IV and V, retired from the Vatican to Vicenza, in northeast Italy. Here he commissioned Andrea Palladio, one of history’s greatest architects, to design a new type of house. Built on a hill overlooking the city and surrounding countryside, La Rotonda was a freestanding villa independent of agriculture, religion or commerce. A place of study, contemplation and quiet enjoyment, it was also a work of impeccable art.\r\n        Neither patron nor architect lived to see La Rotonda completed. Here, though, a thing of beauty was indeed a joy forever. Serene, symmetrical, laced with subtle religious symbolism – its plan a cross set within a square within an imaginary circle – and with classical Ionic porticos facing all four cardinal points of the compass, this exquisite house connected landscape to city while fusing art to architecture. Here was a Renaissance ideal made perfectly real.\r\n        Ever since, and in no matter what style, material or culture, certain architects and enlightened or excitable patrons have aimed to do more or less what Palladio and Almerico did 450 years ago. A new exhibition at New York’s MoMA, Endless House: Intersections of Art and Architecture,  “considers the single-family home and archetypes of dwelling as themes for the creative endeavours of architects and artists”.\r\n        Through engaging drawings, models, videos and installations, the show investigates the house as a means to explore architectural ideas that dovetail with the concerns of art. It also looks at the work of artists who have made the house a focus of their creativity, and by implication it raises the question admirably answered by Palladio and Paulo Almerico: can the house be a work of art?\r\n        The question is timely given that the problem of housing the world’s rapidly growing population has led to intense suburban sprawl along with the spread of shantytowns – not to mention homes and houses, whether cheap or costly, that are as far from art as the hillside favelas of Rio de Janeiro are from the salubriously populated slopes of Vicenza.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuEntertainment-1`,\r\n        title: `Woody Allen sues Amazon for $68m for dropping A Rainy Day in New York`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/entertainment/newsMenuEntertainment-1',\r\n        img: `news-menu-entertainment-img-1`,\r\n        article: `Woody Allen has launched legal action against Amazon Studios, accusing it of breaching their contract by refusing to distribute his latest film.\r\n        The 83-year-old is seeking more than $68m (£52m) in damages, alleging the company backed out of a multi-picture deal without cause.\r\n        Amazon released two of Allen's films and also distributed his TV series, Crisis in Six Scenes.\r\n        But it dropped his most recent movie, A Rainy Day in New York.\r\n        The BBC contacted Amazon Studios for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.\r\n        According to a lawsuit filed on Thursday in New York, Allen claims Amazon backed out of the deal in June 2018 because of an old accusation that the director had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.\r\n        The legal action said Amazon knew about \"a 25-year old, baseless\" allegation when it entered into deals with the director and that it \"does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract\".\r\n        A Rainy Day in New York was shot in 2017 with a cast including Jude Law, Rebecca Hall, Selena Gomez and Timothée Chalamet.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuEntertainment-2`,\r\n        title: `Juliette Binoche says Harvey Weinstein has 'had enough'`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/entertainment/newsMenuEntertainment-2',\r\n        img: `news-menu-entertainment-img-2`,\r\n        article: `Oscar-winning actress Juliette Binoche has called for the public censure of Harvey Weinstein to end, saying \"justice has to do its work\".\r\n        Binoche, who is head of the jury at Berlin Film Festival, said: \"I'm trying to put my feet in his shoes.

Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the best cartoon of 2014 was such a magnificently animated and dazzlingly inventive delight that there was probably only one way its follow-up could go. But it is still depressing to see The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part falling so far short of its glorious predecessor.\r\n        One obvious reason for the shortfall is that the first film caught everyone unawares. Those of us who walked into the cinema fearing a cynical advert for a Danish construction toy brand found ourselves gawping instead at a daring Orwellian satire, the exhilarating and hilarious adventure of a cheerfully conformist construction worker, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who learns that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue every one of Bricksburg’s Lego citizens into place.\r\n        The second shock came when The Lego Movie threw in characters from different franchises – not just the scene-stealingly sullen Batman (Will Arnett), but Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, C-3PO from Star Wars and more. And the third shock was that, as well as being a cartoon set in a land where everyone and everything is made of brightly coloured modular plastic, The Lego Movie was revealed at the end to be the story of a boy (Jadon Sand) named Finn, who is shown in a couple of live-action sequences arguing with his father (Will Ferrell, again) about whether Lego should be played with or collected.\r\n        The sequel lacks these numerous elements of surprise. A second time around, it is no longer a novelty to see characters from separate fictional universes bumping into each other; only a figurine representing a certain US Supreme Court justice is incongruous enough to raise a smile. Moreover, we know from the start that Emmet’s exploits are really just Finn’s games. The last film finished with Bricksburg being invaded by his little sister’s toddler-friendly Duplo bricks, and the new film picks up from there, so it’s clear that whatever happens in the Lego-verse is nothing more than a squabble between a teenage boy and a pre-teen girl.\r\n        The siblings’ main disagreement concerns whether their games should be gritty or glittery. Five years on from the Duplo invasion, Bricksburg has been reduced to a dystopian desert where the Lego characters divide their time between fighting for survival and gazing moodily into the distance. Only Emmet remains as chirpy as ever. This opening sequence is both a parody of Mad Max and a comment on the adolescent conviction that stories set in post-apocalyptic wastelands are “cooler and more mature” than those which aren’t.\r\n        But the film doesn’t stay in this setting for long. A generic alien whisks Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a few of her friends off to another galaxy, and Emmett chases after them with the help of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), a hard-bitten, perma-stubbled hunk with a fist-shaped spacecraft and a crew of talking velociraptors.\r\n        As frenetic and fun as these escapades are, the crux of the plot is that an alien queen (Tiffany Haddish) wants to marry Batman, and Batman’s pals don’t want her to because... well, just because. To put it another way, in The Lego Movie our heroes were trying to save civilisation as they knew it. In the sequel, they are trying to stop a wedding. It’s not the same, is it? The conflict makes sense in the live-action world of Finn and his sister: he wants their Lego play sessions to be grim and action-packed, whereas she wants them to be about wedding preparations. But in the cartoon world of Emmet and Wyldstyle, it isn’t too exciting.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuMovies-2`,\r\n        title: `Academy Adwards 2019: How good are the best picture nominees?`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/movies/newsMenuMovies-2',\r\n        img: `news-menu-movies-img-2`,\r\n        article: `Black Panther. The first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture was also the biggest film of 2018 at the US box office – and was praised by Barber for having a “radical vision in mind – more radical, indeed, than that of any previous Hollywood studio blockbuster”. Director and co-writer, Ryan Coogler (Creed), tells the Marvel story of Wakanda, an ultra-modern utopia hidden in Africa as “an Afrocentric Bond movie” that turns into a sci-fi fantasy. In doing so, Barber argues, he “has taken every genre in which black characters are traditionally sidelined, and then, with considerable flair and boldness, he’s combined those genres and put black characters right at their heart”. With a majority black cast, the blockbuster is a game changer, says Barber. “Ask yourself: when was the last time any feature film, whether or not it was made by a Hollywood studio, posited that an African country might be the happiest, most prosperous and most scientifically advanced place on Earth?”`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuMovies-3`,\r\n        title: `The Favourite's bold sexual politics are rewriting history`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/movies/newsMenuMovies-3',\r\n        img: `news-menu-movies-img-3`,\r\n        article: `Olivia Colman, an Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner for her performance as Queen Anne in The Favourite, tells the BBC she believes that the historical film has “reinvented the genre.

Period pieces can be hard to get off the ground, as costumes, castles and cavalry don’t come cheap: in recent film history, only epics such as Braveheart (1995) and Gladiator (2000) have enjoyed budgets of more than $100 million (£77.5 million). These movies brought home the Oscars, but too often the genre ends up as a noble runner-up, including Elizabeth (1998); The Lion in Winter (1968) and even 1963’s Cleopatra, at the time the most expensive film ever made.

But the more despicable she is, the more you care about her, writes Nicholas Barber.\r\n        Karyn Kusama’s moody Los Angeles cop thriller, Destroyer, is destined to be remembered as the film in which one of Hollywood’s most famously glamorous and elegant superstars, Nicole Kidman, demonstrated just how unglamorous and inelegant she could be. Kidman plays LAPD detective Erin Bell, a name which makes her sound like a Disney character, when she is actually the exact opposite. A gaunt, alcoholic wreck who tends to sleep either in a bar or in her car, Erin has papery, liver-spotted skin; cracked lips; bags over as well as under her eyes; and a mop of greying hair that would probably digest any comb that went near it. Whenever she trudges towards her colleagues, they swear under their breath and back away, mainly because she has become such an embarrassing liability, but partly, you assume, because of the stench that clings to her black leather jacket.\r\n        Kidman’s lack of vanity in the role is impressive, but the film’s truly daring aspect is not how badly Erin looks but how badly she behaves. She alienates her colleagues and beats up her contacts, habits which Hollywood movies usually give to wisecracking rebels. But Erin is less of a cool anti-hero than a hot mess. She has ruined her relationship with her ex-husband (Scoot McNairy) and her teenaged daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn); her working relationship with her partner (Shamier Anderson) isn’t much better; and her barely competent police work seems to be motivated not by a thirst for justice or even revenge, but by half-crazed desperation. For a male film star to play such a hopeless case would be brave enough; for a female film star to do so is almost unprecedented. Destroyer isn’t quite as radical as Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, but both films take action-movie archetypes – the maverick cop, the soldier-turned-mercenary – and examine how deeply miserable such a person would be.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuMovies-6`,\r\n        title: `'Film-making in China is the new way'`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/movies/newsMenuMovies-6',\r\n        img: `news-menu-movies-img-6`,\r\n        article: `“Chinese cinema, and the industry of film-making in China is the new way.”\r\n        That’s the opinion of Nicolas Cage, who was speaking to Talking Movies from the Macau International Film Festival in December 2018, while promoting his latest film, Mandy.\r\n        At one time, it was only Tom Cruise who could bring an Asian audience to a film; now Hollywood is actively courting the East.\r\n        China’s huge audiences have added millions to the box-office takings of recent films like Avengers: Infinity War, Venom and Aquaman, which was released in China before the US.

Is it time for a third ‘summer of love’?\r\n        When you think of LSD, a very specific aesthetic probably leaps to mind: the psychedelic pink-and-orange swirls of the 60s; naked people with flowers in their hair; the shimmer of a sitar. After its psychedelic properties were accidentally discovered in the lab by Albert Hofmann in 1943, the drug was banned in the UK in 1966. LSD is still most strongly associated with hippies who embraced its mind-expanding properties.\r\n        In fact, the drug’s after-effects have seeped through much of Western culture, from art to literature to, most obviously, music, which was never the same after Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix dropped acid. Whole genres have since flagged their debt to mind-altering substances: psychedelic rock, psytrance, acid house... the latter hailing from that other spike in psych: 80s and 90s rave culture. Although ecstasy is the drug most associated with the second summer of love, LSD also saw a resurgence in the UK at that time.\r\n        That was 30 years ago. Are we due another psychedelic renaissance? British playwright Leo Butler hopes so. “There was a need – political, socially – for that LSD explosion in the 60s and the ecstasy explosion in the early 90s,” he tells BBC Culture. “You look at the world now and think, god it could really do with a super-strong psychedelic! We need something to bring us together – let’s have a third summer of love.”\r\n        Having experimented with drugs when he was younger, Butler wanted to write an honest view of the psychedelic experience. But he also wanted to acknowledge the influence of LSD beyond just flower power – and his new show All You Need is LSD brings us right up to the present moment.\r\n        In recent years, LSD has undergone something of a public image shift, from Steve Jobs talking about his experiences to Silicon Valley types advocating microdosing (taking tiny amounts of the drug to boost creativity). The first placebo-controlled study into microdosing was launched in September by the Beckley Foundation and Imperial College London, while the UK has also conducted medical trials that investigate LSD’s potential therapeutic uses. While it may not quite be a summer of love, it might just be the beginning of a new era of openness, even respectability, for the drug.\r\n        This medical interest even found its way into Butler’s play. In 2015, he interviewed former UK government drugs tsar Professor David Nutt, who mentioned he was about to begin the first medical trial on LSD in 50 years. That Tuesday. Would Butler like to take part?`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuMusic-3`,\r\n        title: `Imagine: The making of an iconic song`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/music/newsMenuMusic-3',\r\n        img: `news-menu-music-img-3`,\r\n        article: `With previously unpublished photos and archive interviews, a new book – released on what would have been John Lennon’s 78th birthday – tells the inside story of Imagine.\r\n        It is the ultimate peace anthem; an ode to idealism.

Co-created by Ryan Murphy (Glee, Nip/Tuck, American Horror Story), Pose summons the electrifying energy and fierce style of New York’s real-life black and Latin gay ballroom scene of the 1980s, and contrasts its working-class subcultures with that period’s luxury business world (Trump Tower looms in the background).\r\n        With a second season just announced for 2019, it highlights the continued influence of ‘house’ ball culture: a theme previously explored in Jennie Livingston’s landmark 1991 doc Paris Is Burning, and through musical magpies including Malcolm McLaren (Deep In Vogue) and Madonna’s 1990 megahit Vogue. The original underground moves shook up the mainstream – now they spark fresh expressions, on a broader scale than ever.\r\n        Pose depicts this after-hours party scene, where those excluded from conservative society could express themselves freely, dress fabulously, and find belonging in various family ‘houses’. There is a heady delight in its ball scenes, and a serious respect for ‘realness’, or authenticity. It’s notable for having a cast and crew featuring several trans women, including co-writer/producer/director Jane Mock, and actresses Indya Moore (as Angel Evangelista) and Dominique Jackson (as the formidable house mother Elektra Abundance). Original scene talents, such as Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza (who also danced in Madonna’s Vogue video) cameo as ball judges.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuScience-1`,\r\n        title: `Climate change: UK carbon capture project begins`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/science/newsMenuScience-1',\r\n        img: `news-menu-science-img-1`,\r\n        article: `The giant Drax power station, near Selby in North Yorkshire, has become the first in Europe to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from wood-burning.\r\n        Drax burns seven million tonnes of wood chips each year to drive generators to make electricity.\r\n        The firm has now begun a pilot project to capture one tonne a day of CO2 from its wood combustion.\r\n        The technology effectively turns climate change into reverse on a tiny scale, but it’s controversial.\r\n        How does it reverse climate change?\r\n        When a forest grows, the trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to make their wood.\r\n        If you burn that wood, the process doesn’t emit any extra CO2 into the atmosphere - because the trees removed it from the air in the first place. It’s called carbon neutral.\r\n        If you go one step further by capturing the CO2 from wood burning, you’re actually reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere overall.\r\n        In an ideal world you’d go one step further by creating useful products from the waste CO2.\r\n        Why is it needed?\r\n        This technology is known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).\r\n        Many scientists believe it will be needed because they don't trust politicians to curb the CO2 emissions that are over-heating the planet.\r\n        They say that unless carbon emissions start falling dramatically, we will overshoot the recommended safety limit of a 1.5C rise in global temperature.\r\n        Carbon capture sounds smart – why is it controversial?\r\n        There are two main reasons for controversy.\r\n        First is the impact on the plants and animals living on the huge amount of land needed to grow the trees and plants needed to generate power on a wide scale.\r\n        Second is the amount of additional energy needed to capture and store the carbon.\r\n        Let’s just take the example of Drax.\r\n        The power station generates 6% of the UK’s electricity whilst burning seven million tonnes of wood a year – that’s more wood than is harvested in the whole of Britain. The majority of the supply comes from the US, where forests are expanding as small-scale farmers allow unprofitable land to go back to nature.\r\n        Drax says most of its fuel is residue from forest industries – that’s offcuts and unsuitable trees for timber.\r\n        A previous BBC investigation found that some of the wood almost certainly also comes from species-rich swamp forests in the southern US.\r\n        What if the world wants to generate carbon neutral energy by burning wood?\r\n        This is where the numbers get a bit mind-boggling.\r\n        One estimate suggests that a staggering amount of land would be required to make BECCS feasible under the Paris climate agreement — perhaps as much as three times the area of India.\r\n        Harvard University professor David Keith warned: “We must be cautious of technologies that aim to remediate the carbon problem while greatly expanding our impact on the land.”\r\n        That impact will depend on many variables, such as whether the wood is so-called “waste”; whether it comes from plantation forests or natural forests; how its removal from the forest reduces the amount of material that will lock up carbon in the soil; how it’s transported – and more.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuScience-2`,\r\n        title: `Climate change: 'Future proofing' forests to protect orangutans`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/science/newsMenuScience-2',\r\n        img: `news-menu-science-img-2`,\r\n        article: `A study has identified key tree species that are resilient to climate change and support critically endangered apes.\r\n        Planting them could help future proof rainforests, which are a key habitat for orangutans, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.\r\n        Researchers surveyed 250 plants in Indonesia's Kutai National Park.\r\n        Over 1,000 orangutans are thought to inhabit the park, as well as other rare animals such as the Malayan sun bear.\r\n        \"Selecting which species to plant is a significant contribution to restoring the health of this ecosystem,\" said study co-author Douglas Sheil.\r\n        \"Of course, the reasons why forest cover was lost in the first place must also be addressed for reforestation efforts to succeed.\"\r\n        Kutai National Park is located on the east coast of Borneo Island, in the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia.\r\n        The forest faces threats from logging, fires and mining, and was once considered a conservation wasteland.\r\n        Efforts are underway to try to restore the habitat, which is home to more than a thousand plants, 80 mammals and 300 birds, including what is thought to be the largest population of orangutans in the province.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: `newsMenuScience-3`,\r\n        title: `Herbal history: Five garden plants with a hidden past`,\r\n        description: ``,\r\n        link: '/news-menu/science/newsMenuScience-3',\r\n        img: `news-menu-science-img-3`,\r\n        article: `Many garden plants we're familiar with today have a hidden history.\r\n        Grown centuries ago for their reputed healing powers, they became garden staples, valued for their beauty, form or scent.\r\n        Pulmonaria, with its spotted leaves, was thought to symbolise diseased lungs, and used for chest infections.\r\n        And the mint now found in a pot by the door was recommended to \"stayeth bleeding\" by early herbalists and apothecaries.\r\n        There's more to garden plants than just their aesthetics, says Fiona Davison, head of libraries and exhibitions at the Royal Horticultural Society, RHS.\r\n        Plants generally don't get into gardens by accident, she says - they have a long relationship with people. \"It's been a long story of people choosing particular plants, nurturing them, growing them, breeding them, making choices of which seedling they would select to carry on growing,\" she says.\r\n        \"And a lot of times those choices have been made on aesthetics, but a lot of times those choices have been made on the basis of what they thought the plant would do for you, from a medicinal point of view.\"\r\n        Studies of plants by ancient herbalists paved the way for the formal study of plants by the first botanists, many of whom were also physicians.
