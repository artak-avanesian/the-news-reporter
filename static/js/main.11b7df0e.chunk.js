How many of those rating the film had a classical education is unclear, but perhaps it would have performed better had its producers done their research. As according to British art historian Elizabeth McGrath\u2019s 1992 article The Black Andromeda, Andromeda was, indeed, originally depicted as a black princess from Ethiopia.","Anyone who watched either of the two Clash of the Titans films will know that Judi Bowker and Alexa Devalos are both white women, and anyone who has seen Andromeda in a painting \u2013 perhaps Titian\u2019s or Poynter\u2019s \u2013 will believe she is white too. But McGrath\u2019s article was definitive in addressing three things: that all the Greek mythographers placed Andromeda as a princess of Ethiopia, that Ovid specifically refers to her dark skin and that artists throughout Western art history frequently omitted to depict her blackness because Andromeda was supposed to be beautiful, and blackness and beauty \u2013 for many of them \u2013 was dichotomous.

We do know that there was active debate about her skin colour, a debate that would certainly seem racist to modern eyes.

Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the best cartoon of 2014 was such a magnificently animated and dazzlingly inventive delight that there was probably only one way its follow-up could go. But it is still depressing to see The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part falling so far short of its glorious predecessor.","One obvious reason for the shortfall is that the first film caught everyone unawares. Those of us who walked into the cinema fearing a cynical advert for a Danish construction toy brand found ourselves gawping instead at a daring Orwellian satire, the exhilarating and hilarious adventure of a cheerfully conformist construction worker, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who learns that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue every one of Bricksburg\u2019s Lego citizens into place.","The second shock came when The Lego Movie threw in characters from different franchises \u2013 not just the scene-stealingly sullen Batman (Will Arnett), but Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, C-3PO from Star Wars and more. And the third shock was that, as well as being a cartoon set in a land where everyone and everything is made of brightly coloured modular plastic, The Lego Movie was revealed at the end to be the story of a boy (Jadon Sand) named Finn, who is shown in a couple of live-action sequences arguing with his father (Will Ferrell, again) about whether Lego should be played with or collected.","The sequel lacks these numerous elements of surprise. A second time around, it is no longer a novelty to see characters from separate fictional universes bumping into each other; only a figurine representing a certain US Supreme Court justice is incongruous enough to raise a smile. Moreover, we know from the start that Emmet\u2019s exploits are really just Finn\u2019s games. The last film finished with Bricksburg being invaded by his little sister\u2019s toddler-friendly Duplo bricks, and the new film picks up from there, so it\u2019s clear that whatever happens in the Lego-verse is nothing more than a squabble between a teenage boy and a pre-teen girl.","The siblings\u2019 main disagreement concerns whether their games should be gritty or glittery. Five years on from the Duplo invasion, Bricksburg has been reduced to a dystopian desert where the Lego characters divide their time between fighting for survival and gazing moodily into the distance. Only Emmet remains as chirpy as ever. This opening sequence is both a parody of Mad Max and a comment on the adolescent conviction that stories set in post-apocalyptic wastelands are \u201ccooler and more mature\u201d than those which aren\u2019t.","But the film doesn\u2019t stay in this setting for long. A generic alien whisks Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a few of her friends off to another galaxy, and Emmett chases after them with the help of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), a hard-bitten, perma-stubbled hunk with a fist-shaped spacecraft and a crew of talking velociraptors.","As frenetic and fun as these escapades are, the crux of the plot is that an alien queen (Tiffany Haddish) wants to marry Batman, and Batman\u2019s pals don\u2019t want her to because... well, just because. To put it another way, in The Lego Movie our heroes were trying to save civilisation as they knew it. In the sequel, they are trying to stop a wedding. It\u2019s not the same, is it? The conflict makes sense in the live-action world of Finn and his sister: he wants their Lego play sessions to be grim and action-packed, whereas she wants them to be about wedding preparations. But in the cartoon world of Emmet and Wyldstyle, it isn\u2019t too exciting."]},{newsMenuMoviesId:"newsMenuMovies-2",newsMenuMoviesTitle:"Academy Adwards 2019: How good are the best picture nominees?",newsMenuMoviesImg:"news-menu-movies-img-2",newsMenuMoviesArticle:["Black Panther","The first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture was also the biggest film of 2018 at the US box office \u2013 and was praised by Barber for having a \u201cradical vision in mind \u2013 more radical, indeed, than that of any previous Hollywood studio blockbuster\u201d.

But the more despicable she is, the more you care about her, writes Nicholas Barber.","Karyn Kusama\u2019s moody Los Angeles cop thriller, Destroyer, is destined to be remembered as the film in which one of Hollywood\u2019s most famously glamorous and elegant superstars, Nicole Kidman, demonstrated just how unglamorous and inelegant she could be. Kidman plays LAPD detective Erin Bell, a name which makes her sound like a Disney character, when she is actually the exact opposite. A gaunt, alcoholic wreck who tends to sleep either in a bar or in her car, Erin has papery, liver-spotted skin; cracked lips; bags over as well as under her eyes; and a mop of greying hair that would probably digest any comb that went near it. Whenever she trudges towards her colleagues, they swear under their breath and back away, mainly because she has become such an embarrassing liability, but partly, you assume, because of the stench that clings to her black leather jacket.","Kidman\u2019s lack of vanity in the role is impressive, but the film\u2019s truly daring aspect is not how badly Erin looks but how badly she behaves. She alienates her colleagues and beats up her contacts, habits which Hollywood movies usually give to wisecracking rebels. But Erin is less of a cool anti-hero than a hot mess. She has ruined her relationship with her ex-husband (Scoot McNairy) and her teenaged daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn); her working relationship with her partner (Shamier Anderson) isn\u2019t much better; and her barely competent police work seems to be motivated not by a thirst for justice or even revenge, but by half-crazed desperation. For a male film star to play such a hopeless case would be brave enough; for a female film star to do so is almost unprecedented.","Destroyer isn\u2019t quite as radical as Lynne Ramsay\u2019s You Were Never Really Here, but both films take action-movie archetypes \u2013 the maverick cop, the soldier-turned-mercenary \u2013 and examine how deeply miserable such a person would be."]},{newsMenuMoviesId:"newsMenuMovies-6",newsMenuMoviesTitle:"'Film-making in China is the new way'",newsMenuMoviesImg:"news-menu-movies-img-6",newsMenuMoviesArticle:["\u201cChinese cinema, and the industry of film-making in China is the new way.\u201d","That\u2019s the opinion of Nicolas Cage, who was speaking to Talking Movies from the Macau International Film Festival in December 2018, while promoting his latest film, Mandy.","At one time, it was only Tom Cruise who could bring an Asian audience to a film; now Hollywood is actively courting the East.","China\u2019s huge audiences have added millions to the box-office takings of recent films like Avengers: Infinity War, Venom and Aquaman, which was released in China before the US.

This technology is known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).","Many scientists believe it will be needed because they don't trust politicians to curb the CO2 emissions that are over-heating the planet.\n            They say that unless carbon emissions start falling dramatically, we will overshoot the recommended safety limit of a 1.5C rise in global temperature.\n            Carbon capture sounds smart \u2013 why is it controversial?\n            There are two main reasons for controversy."," First is the impact on the plants and animals living on the huge amount of land needed to grow the trees and plants needed to generate power on a wide scale.\n            Second is the amount of additional energy needed to capture and store the carbon.\n            Let\u2019s just take the example of Drax.","The power station generates 6% of the UK\u2019s electricity whilst burning seven million tonnes of wood a year \u2013 that\u2019s more wood than is harvested in the whole of Britain. The majority of the supply comes from the US, where forests are expanding as small-scale farmers allow unprofitable land to go back to nature.\n            Drax says most of its fuel is residue from forest industries \u2013 that\u2019s offcuts and unsuitable trees for timber.","A previous BBC investigation found that some of the wood almost certainly also comes from species-rich swamp forests in the southern US.\n            What if the world wants to generate carbon neutral energy by burning wood?\n            This is where the numbers get a bit mind-boggling.\n            One estimate suggests that a staggering amount of land would be required to make BECCS feasible under the Paris climate agreement \u2014 perhaps as much as three times the area of India.","Harvard University professor David Keith warned: \u201cWe must be cautious of technologies that aim to remediate the carbon problem while greatly expanding our impact on the land.\u201d That impact will depend on many variables, such as whether the wood is so-called \u201cwaste\u201d; whether it comes from plantation forests or natural forests; how its removal from the forest reduces the amount of material that will lock up carbon in the soil; how it\u2019s transported \u2013 and more."]},{newsMenuScienceId:"newsMenuScience-2",newsMenuScienceTitle:"Climate change: 'Future proofing' forests to protect orangutans",newsMenuScienceImg:"news-menu-science-img-2",newsMenuScienceArticle:["A study has identified key tree species that are resilient to climate change and support critically endangered apes.\n            Planting them could help future proof rainforests, which are a key habitat for orangutans, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.","Researchers surveyed 250 plants in Indonesia's Kutai National Park.\n            Over 1,000 orangutans are thought to inhabit the park, as well as other rare animals such as the Malayan sun bear.",'"Selecting which species to plant is a significant contribution to restoring the health of this ecosystem," said study co-author Douglas Sheil.\n            "Of course, the reasons why forest cover was lost in the first place must also be addressed for reforestation efforts to succeed."\n            Kutai National Park is located on the east coast of Borneo Island, in the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia.',"The forest faces threats from logging, fires and mining, and was once considered a conservation wasteland.\n            Efforts are underway to try to restore the habitat, which is home to more than a thousand plants, 80 mammals and 300 birds, including what is thought to be the largest population of orangutans in the province."]},{newsMenuScienceId:"newsMenuScience-3",newsMenuScienceTitle:"Herbal history: Five garden plants with a hidden past",newsMenuScienceImg:"news-menu-science-img-3",newsMenuScienceArticle:["Many garden plants we're familiar with today have a hidden history.\n            Grown centuries ago for their reputed healing powers, they became garden staples, valued for their beauty, form or scent.",'Pulmonaria, with its spotted leaves, was thought to symbolise diseased lungs, and used for chest infections.

At nearly 800 sites across the country and thousands more around the world, dams contain huge loads of mining waste.",'One British scientist, Dr Stephen Edwards of UCL, has warned that "we are sitting on a time bomb". He told BBC News that further disasters were inevitable.',"Over the last few days in the heart of Brazil's mining belt, I've been investigating two very different sites where the risks of massive damage seem plausible. One is a vast lake of sludge perched high above a nervous community; the other is an abandoned gold mine at risk of leaking poisons.\n            Why are there dumps of mining waste?\n            The answer begins with the world's growing demand for metals such as steel which is used to make everything from buildings to ships to cars.","The key ingredient of steel is iron ore which is extracted from the ground in huge mines - Brazil is one of the world's largest producers. he ore is broken up, and because only a small fraction of the rock is actually iron, the vast majority is unwanted, a by-product that's thrown away.\n            And the cheapest way to dispose of these remains is to create what's called a \"tailings pond\" - a rather genteel term for a dumping-ground sealed with a dam.","Are these dumps easy to find?\n            Not always. The mining companies tend to tuck them away in valleys in the hills. We used satellite mapping to find one of the largest tailings ponds in Brazil, a site called Maravilhas II, owned by the mining giant Vale which also owns the dam that failed last month.","Stretching as far as the eye can see is what looks like a sea of red mud, streaked with swirls of black and grey, a mass of sludge."]},{newsMenuScienceId:"newsMenuScience-5",newsMenuScienceTitle:"Rosalind Franklin: Mars rover named after DNA pioneer",newsMenuScienceImg:"news-menu-science-img-5",newsMenuScienceArticle:["The UK-assembled rover that will be sent to Mars in 2020 will bear the name of DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin.

As it was reported, 59-year-old Hashoggi was killed on October 2 at the Consulate General of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, when he went there to pick up the documents required for the future wedding. His bride was not allowed to enter the institution and after five hours of waiting she was informed that Hashoggi had already left the consulate. The journalist had long ties to the royal family of Saudi Arabia, but he critically wrote about the current government and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In Turkey, they suspect that her husband was questioned, tortured, and then killed and dismembered. For this purpose, 15 officers of the Saudi security services flew to Istanbul on that day. The investigation has sound recordings. After several weeks of objections and under heavy pressure from the West, the Saudi authorities still admitted that the journalist was killed in their consulate. Subsequently, the Turkish authorities reported that, a few days after the assassination of Hashoggi, Saudi Arabia sent a group of 11 experts to Turkey, including a chemist and a toxicologist who had to "cover the traces" of the crime.'},{id:"world-news-article-2",title:"California in the fire: a powerful fire destroys forests, houses and cars",img:"fav-world-news-img-2",link:"/world-news-articles/world-news-article-2",description:"Several people were injured in the fire.

If you are familiar with this junction you would know it is far from the US\u2019 current coastline. But in Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s novel New York 2140, Manhattan is flooded after unabated climate change causes the sea level to rise by 50ft (15.25m). The amphibian city is now a SuperVenice, a grid of canals populated by vaporettos where characters must learn how to deal with a world both familiar and unrecognisable to us. Mid-Manhattan skimboading is all too possible in this future.\n        Robinson\u2019s 2017 climate-fiction novel belongs to a growing cadre of works about drowned nations, wind farm utopias or scarred metropolises decades into the future. As diplomats draft the rulebook for the global response to the climate crisis and engineers race to produce better solar panels, writers have found their role, too: telling what Robinson calls \u201cthe story of the next century\u201d. In doing that, they might be helping readers across the world comprehend the situation in which we currently find ourselves.  \n        Climate change is a notoriously elusive crisis to make sense of, particularly compared to other human-impact catastrophes. Drop some toxic chemicals in a river now and you will see dead fish within days, but what do you witness when you release carbon dioxide? And while, in 2018, a report by UN climate scientists stated that we are heading towards a catastrophe, who can truly imagine what that looks like?\n        This is where fiction comes in: it brings the abstract data closer to home by focusing on the faces and stories in these futures. Show readers a detailed and textured account of a climate-changed future, says Robinson, and they have an easier time imagining it. It feels real: characters in these novels worry about the welfare of their children, meddle in extra-marital affairs and grapple with train schedules, just as readers would on their daily lives.\n        Abstract futures\n        \u201cScience fiction gets people thinking in a way that another report on climate change doesn\u2019t,\u201d says Shelley Streeby, a Professor of Literature and Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego. \u201cIt helps people feel about what might be coming, but also about the present.\u201d\n        The numbers for climate fiction, or cli-fi as some people call it, are hard to pinpoint \u2013 but they are growing fast. A 2016 review tallied 50 novels dealing specifically with man-made climate change and its effects, with 20 appearing in the previous five years, although this number includes all types of novels.

Drawing on sources as varied as the novels of Agatha Christie and French silent film, he created a uniquely macabre vision of the world filled with crumbling English mansions, jittery dark-eyed flappers and stony faced Edwardian gents where nothing is quite as it seems. His virtuosic illustrations and poetic texts have drawn comparisons to Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear and Samuel Beckett, winning him critical acclaim and a devoted cult following in his native US. Lemony Snicket. Gorey himself was a complicated, reclusive individual whose mission in life was \u201cto make everybody as uneasy as possible\u201d. He collected daguerreotypes of dead babies and lived alone with 20,000 books and six cats in his New York apartment. Sporting an Edwardian beard, he would frequently traipse around the city in a full-length fur coat accessorised with trainers and jangling bracelets.\n        A precociously gifted child, he grew up in depression-era Chicago, learning to draw at the age of one-and-a-half and teaching himself to read at three.

Friends believe his fantasy could never have coped with the reality. Regular trips to the theatre, ballet and concerts were instrumental in turning him into a cultural omnivore, a tendency which expanded even further once he entered Harvard after World War Two.\n        Here his social circle revolved around what Mark Dery, author of Gorey\u2019s first major biography Born to be Posthumous, refers to as the \u201cgay literati\u201d, including the poet Frank O\u2019Hara with whom he shared a passion for obscure literature.

His elegantly elongated figures and sombre palette, inspired both by the English illustrator Edward Ardizzone and the Japanese Ukiyo-e prints he loved, were in marked contrast to the pulp fiction-inspired covers prevalent at the time.\n        The Anchor job meant a move to New York, which did not enthuse him, but opened up a whole new world of cultural possibilities. At the silent film evenings run by the film historian William K Everson, he discovered the work of French film-maker Louis Feuillade. His gothic-macabre crime thrillers Fant\xf4mas and Les Vampires would become \u201cthe greatest influence on my work. Period,\u201d Gorey later said.

Such was the film\u2019s popularity that it was remade in 2010; the film managed a rather disparaging 26% on the Rotten Tomatoes site. How many of those rating the film had a classical education is unclear, but perhaps it would have performed better had its producers done their research. As according to British art historian Elizabeth McGrath\u2019s 1992 article The Black Andromeda, Andromeda was, indeed, originally depicted as a black princess from Ethiopia.\n        Anyone who watched either of the two Clash of the Titans films will know that Judi Bowker and Alexa Devalos are both white women, and anyone who has seen Andromeda in a painting \u2013 perhaps Titian\u2019s or Poynter\u2019s \u2013 will believe she is white too. But McGrath\u2019s article was definitive in addressing three things: that all the Greek mythographers placed Andromeda as a princess of Ethiopia, that Ovid specifically refers to her dark skin and that artists throughout Western art history frequently omitted to depict her blackness because Andromeda was supposed to be beautiful, and blackness and beauty \u2013 for many of them \u2013 was dichotomous.

We do know that there was active debate about her skin colour, a debate that would certainly seem racist to modern eyes. McGrath references Francisco Pacheco, a Spanish artist and writer, who asks in one passage of his book Arte de la Pintura why Andromeda is so often painted as white-skinned when several of the sources say she is black.

Thinking about the way my grandparents were, and the traditional way of Japanese life, I thought we could stop and look around and accept the things that we don\u2019t normally appreciate, like getting older.\u201d\n        Calmness seeps through many of the phrases, whether it\u2019s derived from accepting elements beyond our control or being respectful in all our encounters. South African artist David Buchler \u2013 who has written short essays for the book \u2013 has lived in Japan for seven years. \u201cWhen I speak to people in Japanese, I\u2019m very aware of what I\u2019m saying and my gestures and being polite, thinking about how my words would affect them,\u201d he tells BBC Culture. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different approach to talking.\u201d\n        The book covers vast topics including \u2018harmony\u2019, \u2018gratitude\u2019 and \u2018time\u2019 \u2013 but it isn\u2019t an abstract dictionary. Instead, Fujimoto offers a way into a culture that can often seem remote to foreigners. So, for Shibui, which \u201crecalls the beauty revealed by the passage of time\u201d, she writes: \u201cInhering in an aesthetic of calm \u2013 colours subdued and brightness muted \u2013 this word reminds us to appreciate the things that improve with age. There is a grace in maturity, and the experiences of life mark their objects with a pleasant richness.

Here he commissioned Andrea Palladio, one of history\u2019s greatest architects, to design a new type of house. Built on a hill overlooking the city and surrounding countryside, La Rotonda was a freestanding villa independent of agriculture, religion or commerce. A place of study, contemplation and quiet enjoyment, it was also a work of impeccable art.\n        Neither patron nor architect lived to see La Rotonda completed. Here, though, a thing of beauty was indeed a joy forever. Serene, symmetrical, laced with subtle religious symbolism \u2013 its plan a cross set within a square within an imaginary circle \u2013 and with classical Ionic porticos facing all four cardinal points of the compass, this exquisite house connected landscape to city while fusing art to architecture. Here was a Renaissance ideal made perfectly real.\n        Ever since, and in no matter what style, material or culture, certain architects and enlightened or excitable patrons have aimed to do more or less what Palladio and Almerico did 450 years ago.

It also looks at the work of artists who have made the house a focus of their creativity, and by implication it raises the question admirably answered by Palladio and Paulo Almerico: can the house be a work of art?\n        The question is timely given that the problem of housing the world\u2019s rapidly growing population has led to intense suburban sprawl along with the spread of shantytowns \u2013 not to mention homes and houses, whether cheap or costly, that are as far from art as the hillside favelas of Rio de Janeiro are from the salubriously populated slopes of Vicenza."},{id:"newsMenuEntertainment-1",title:"Woody Allen sues Amazon for $68m for dropping A Rainy Day in New York",description:"",link:"/news-menu/entertainment/newsMenuEntertainment-1",img:"news-menu-entertainment-img-1",article:'Woody Allen has launched legal action against Amazon Studios, accusing it of breaching their contract by refusing to distribute his latest film.\n        The 83-year-old is seeking more than $68m (\xa352m) in damages, alleging the company backed out of a multi-picture deal without cause.\n        Amazon released two of Allen\'s films and also distributed his TV series, Crisis in Six Scenes.\n        But it dropped his most recent movie, A Rainy Day in New York.\n        The BBC contacted Amazon Studios for comment, but did not receive an immediate reply.\n        According to a lawsuit filed on Thursday in New York, Allen claims Amazon backed out of the deal in June 2018 because of an old accusation that the director had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.\n        The legal action said Amazon knew about "a 25-year old, baseless" allegation when it entered into deals with the director and that it "does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract".\n        A Rainy Day in New York was shot in 2017 with a cast including Jude Law, Rebecca Hall, Selena Gomez and Timoth\xe9e Chalamet.'},{id:"newsMenuEntertainment-2",title:"Juliette Binoche says Harvey Weinstein has 'had enough'",description:"",link:"/news-menu/entertainment/newsMenuEntertainment-2",img:"news-menu-entertainment-img-2",article:'Oscar-winning actress Juliette Binoche has called for the public censure of Harvey Weinstein to end, saying "justice has to do its work".\n        Binoche, who is head of the jury at Berlin Film Festival, said: "I\'m trying to put my feet in his shoes.

Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the best cartoon of 2014 was such a magnificently animated and dazzlingly inventive delight that there was probably only one way its follow-up could go. But it is still depressing to see The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part falling so far short of its glorious predecessor.\n        One obvious reason for the shortfall is that the first film caught everyone unawares. Those of us who walked into the cinema fearing a cynical advert for a Danish construction toy brand found ourselves gawping instead at a daring Orwellian satire, the exhilarating and hilarious adventure of a cheerfully conformist construction worker, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who learns that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plans to glue every one of Bricksburg\u2019s Lego citizens into place.\n        The second shock came when The Lego Movie threw in characters from different franchises \u2013 not just the scene-stealingly sullen Batman (Will Arnett), but Gandalf from The Lord of the Rings, C-3PO from Star Wars and more. And the third shock was that, as well as being a cartoon set in a land where everyone and everything is made of brightly coloured modular plastic, The Lego Movie was revealed at the end to be the story of a boy (Jadon Sand) named Finn, who is shown in a couple of live-action sequences arguing with his father (Will Ferrell, again) about whether Lego should be played with or collected.\n        The sequel lacks these numerous elements of surprise. A second time around, it is no longer a novelty to see characters from separate fictional universes bumping into each other; only a figurine representing a certain US Supreme Court justice is incongruous enough to raise a smile. Moreover, we know from the start that Emmet\u2019s exploits are really just Finn\u2019s games. The last film finished with Bricksburg being invaded by his little sister\u2019s toddler-friendly Duplo bricks, and the new film picks up from there, so it\u2019s clear that whatever happens in the Lego-verse is nothing more than a squabble between a teenage boy and a pre-teen girl.\n        The siblings\u2019 main disagreement concerns whether their games should be gritty or glittery. Five years on from the Duplo invasion, Bricksburg has been reduced to a dystopian desert where the Lego characters divide their time between fighting for survival and gazing moodily into the distance. Only Emmet remains as chirpy as ever. This opening sequence is both a parody of Mad Max and a comment on the adolescent conviction that stories set in post-apocalyptic wastelands are \u201ccooler and more mature\u201d than those which aren\u2019t.\n        But the film doesn\u2019t stay in this setting for long. A generic alien whisks Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a few of her friends off to another galaxy, and Emmett chases after them with the help of Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), a hard-bitten, perma-stubbled hunk with a fist-shaped spacecraft and a crew of talking velociraptors.\n        As frenetic and fun as these escapades are, the crux of the plot is that an alien queen (Tiffany Haddish) wants to marry Batman, and Batman\u2019s pals don\u2019t want her to because... well, just because. To put it another way, in The Lego Movie our heroes were trying to save civilisation as they knew it. In the sequel, they are trying to stop a wedding. It\u2019s not the same, is it? The conflict makes sense in the live-action world of Finn and his sister: he wants their Lego play sessions to be grim and action-packed, whereas she wants them to be about wedding preparations. But in the cartoon world of Emmet and Wyldstyle, it isn\u2019t too exciting."},{id:"newsMenuMovies-2",title:"Academy Adwards 2019: How good are the best picture nominees?",description:"",link:"/news-menu/movies/newsMenuMovies-2",img:"news-menu-movies-img-2",article:"Black Panther.

But the more despicable she is, the more you care about her, writes Nicholas Barber.\n        Karyn Kusama\u2019s moody Los Angeles cop thriller, Destroyer, is destined to be remembered as the film in which one of Hollywood\u2019s most famously glamorous and elegant superstars, Nicole Kidman, demonstrated just how unglamorous and inelegant she could be. Kidman plays LAPD detective Erin Bell, a name which makes her sound like a Disney character, when she is actually the exact opposite. A gaunt, alcoholic wreck who tends to sleep either in a bar or in her car, Erin has papery, liver-spotted skin; cracked lips; bags over as well as under her eyes; and a mop of greying hair that would probably digest any comb that went near it. Whenever she trudges towards her colleagues, they swear under their breath and back away, mainly because she has become such an embarrassing liability, but partly, you assume, because of the stench that clings to her black leather jacket.\n        Kidman\u2019s lack of vanity in the role is impressive, but the film\u2019s truly daring aspect is not how badly Erin looks but how badly she behaves. She alienates her colleagues and beats up her contacts, habits which Hollywood movies usually give to wisecracking rebels. But Erin is less of a cool anti-hero than a hot mess. She has ruined her relationship with her ex-husband (Scoot McNairy) and her teenaged daughter Shelby (Jade Pettyjohn); her working relationship with her partner (Shamier Anderson) isn\u2019t much better; and her barely competent police work seems to be motivated not by a thirst for justice or even revenge, but by half-crazed desperation. For a male film star to play such a hopeless case would be brave enough; for a female film star to do so is almost unprecedented. Destroyer isn\u2019t quite as radical as Lynne Ramsay\u2019s You Were Never Really Here, but both films take action-movie archetypes \u2013 the maverick cop, the soldier-turned-mercenary \u2013 and examine how deeply miserable such a person would be."},{id:"newsMenuMovies-6",title:"'Film-making in China is the new way'",description:"",link:"/news-menu/movies/newsMenuMovies-6",img:"news-menu-movies-img-6",article:"\u201cChinese cinema, and the industry of film-making in China is the new way.\u201d\n        That\u2019s the opinion of Nicolas Cage, who was speaking to Talking Movies from the Macau International Film Festival in December 2018, while promoting his latest film, Mandy.\n        At one time, it was only Tom Cruise who could bring an Asian audience to a film; now Hollywood is actively courting the East.\n        China\u2019s huge audiences have added millions to the box-office takings of recent films like Avengers: Infinity War, Venom and Aquaman, which was released in China before the US.

Is it time for a third \u2018summer of love\u2019?\n        When you think of LSD, a very specific aesthetic probably leaps to mind: the psychedelic pink-and-orange swirls of the 60s; naked people with flowers in their hair; the shimmer of a sitar. After its psychedelic properties were accidentally discovered in the lab by Albert Hofmann in 1943, the drug was banned in the UK in 1966. LSD is still most strongly associated with hippies who embraced its mind-expanding properties.\n        In fact, the drug\u2019s after-effects have seeped through much of Western culture, from art to literature to, most obviously, music, which was never the same after Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix dropped acid. Whole genres have since flagged their debt to mind-altering substances: psychedelic rock, psytrance, acid house... the latter hailing from that other spike in psych: 80s and 90s rave culture. Although ecstasy is the drug most associated with the second summer of love, LSD also saw a resurgence in the UK at that time.\n        That was 30 years ago. Are we due another psychedelic renaissance? British playwright Leo Butler hopes so. \u201cThere was a need \u2013 political, socially \u2013 for that LSD explosion in the 60s and the ecstasy explosion in the early 90s,\u201d he tells BBC Culture. \u201cYou look at the world now and think, god it could really do with a super-strong psychedelic! We need something to bring us together \u2013 let\u2019s have a third summer of love.\u201d\n        Having experimented with drugs when he was younger, Butler wanted to write an honest view of the psychedelic experience. But he also wanted to acknowledge the influence of LSD beyond just flower power \u2013 and his new show All You Need is LSD brings us right up to the present moment.\n        In recent years, LSD has undergone something of a public image shift, from Steve Jobs talking about his experiences to Silicon Valley types advocating microdosing (taking tiny amounts of the drug to boost creativity). The first placebo-controlled study into microdosing was launched in September by the Beckley Foundation and Imperial College London, while the UK has also conducted medical trials that investigate LSD\u2019s potential therapeutic uses. While it may not quite be a summer of love, it might just be the beginning of a new era of openness, even respectability, for the drug.\n        This medical interest even found its way into Butler\u2019s play. In 2015, he interviewed former UK government drugs tsar Professor David Nutt, who mentioned he was about to begin the first medical trial on LSD in 50 years. That Tuesday.

It\u2019s called carbon neutral.\n        If you go one step further by capturing the CO2 from wood burning, you\u2019re actually reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere overall.\n        In an ideal world you\u2019d go one step further by creating useful products from the waste CO2.\n        Why is it needed?\n        This technology is known as Bio Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).\n        Many scientists believe it will be needed because they don't trust politicians to curb the CO2 emissions that are over-heating the planet.\n        They say that unless carbon emissions start falling dramatically, we will overshoot the recommended safety limit of a 1.5C rise in global temperature.\n        Carbon capture sounds smart \u2013 why is it controversial?\n        There are two main reasons for controversy.\n        First is the impact on the plants and animals living on the huge amount of land needed to grow the trees and plants needed to generate power on a wide scale.\n        Second is the amount of additional energy needed to capture and store the carbon.\n        Let\u2019s just take the example of Drax.\n        The power station generates 6% of the UK\u2019s electricity whilst burning seven million tonnes of wood a year \u2013 that\u2019s more wood than is harvested in the whole of Britain. The majority of the supply comes from the US, where forests are expanding as small-scale farmers allow unprofitable land to go back to nature.\n        Drax says most of its fuel is residue from forest industries \u2013 that\u2019s offcuts and unsuitable trees for timber.\n        A previous BBC investigation found that some of the wood almost certainly also comes from species-rich swamp forests in the southern US.\n        What if the world wants to generate carbon neutral energy by burning wood?\n        This is where the numbers get a bit mind-boggling.\n        One estimate suggests that a staggering amount of land would be required to make BECCS feasible under the Paris climate agreement \u2014 perhaps as much as three times the area of India.\n        Harvard University professor David Keith warned: \u201cWe must be cautious of technologies that aim to remediate the carbon problem while greatly expanding our impact on the land.\u201d\n        That impact will depend on many variables, such as whether the wood is so-called \u201cwaste\u201d; whether it comes from plantation forests or natural forests; how its removal from the forest reduces the amount of material that will lock up carbon in the soil; how it\u2019s transported \u2013 and more."},{id:"newsMenuScience-2",title:"Climate change: 'Future proofing' forests to protect orangutans",description:"",link:"/news-menu/science/newsMenuScience-2",img:"news-menu-science-img-2",article:'A study has identified key tree species that are resilient to climate change and support critically endangered apes.\n        Planting them could help future proof rainforests, which are a key habitat for orangutans, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.\n        Researchers surveyed 250 plants in Indonesia\'s Kutai National Park.\n        Over 1,000 orangutans are thought to inhabit the park, as well as other rare animals such as the Malayan sun bear.\n        "Selecting which species to plant is a significant contribution to restoring the health of this ecosystem," said study co-author Douglas Sheil.\n        "Of course, the reasons why forest cover was lost in the first place must also be addressed for reforestation efforts to succeed."\n        Kutai National Park is located on the east coast of Borneo Island, in the East Kalimantan province of Indonesia.\n        The forest faces threats from logging, fires and mining, and was once considered a conservation wasteland.\n        Efforts are underway to try to restore the habitat, which is home to more than a thousand plants, 80 mammals and 300 birds, including what is thought to be the largest population of orangutans in the province.'},{id:"newsMenuScience-3",title:"Herbal history: Five garden plants with a hidden past",description:"",link:"/news-menu/science/newsMenuScience-3",img:"news-menu-science-img-3",article:'Many garden plants we\'re familiar with today have a hidden history.\n        Grown centuries ago for their reputed healing powers, they became garden staples, valued for their beauty, form or scent.\n        Pulmonaria, with its spotted leaves, was thought to symbolise diseased lungs, and used for chest infections.\n        And the mint now found in a pot by the door was recommended to "stayeth bleeding" by early herbalists and apothecaries.\n        There\'s more to garden plants than just their aesthetics, says Fiona Davison, head of libraries and exhibitions at the Royal Horticultural Society, RHS.\n        Plants generally don\'t get into gardens by accident, she says - they have a long relationship with people.

One is a vast lake of sludge perched high above a nervous community; the other is an abandoned gold mine at risk of leaking poisons.\n        Why are there dumps of mining waste?\n        The answer begins with the world's growing demand for metals such as steel which is used to make everything from buildings to ships to cars.\n        The key ingredient of steel is iron ore which is extracted from the ground in huge mines - Brazil is one of the world's largest producers. he ore is broken up, and because only a small fraction of the rock is actually iron, the vast majority is unwanted, a by-product that's thrown away.\n        And the cheapest way to dispose of these remains is to create what's called a \"tailings pond\" - a rather genteel term for a dumping-ground sealed with a dam.\n        Are these dumps easy to find?\n        Not always. The mining companies tend to tuck them away in valleys in the hills.\n        We used satellite mapping to find one of the largest tailings ponds in Brazil, a site called Maravilhas II, owned by the mining giant Vale which also owns the dam that failed last month.\n        Stretching as far as the eye can see is what looks like a sea of red mud, streaked with swirls of black and grey, a mass of sludge."},{id:"newsMenuScience-5",title:"Rosalind Franklin: Mars rover named after DNA pioneer",description:"",link:"/news-menu/science/newsMenuScience-5",img:"news-menu-science-img-5",article:'The UK-assembled rover that will be sent to Mars in 2020 will bear the name of DNA pioneer Rosalind Franklin.\n        The honour follows a public call for suggestions that drew nearly 36,000 responses from right across Europe.\n        Astronaut Tim Peake unveiled the name at the Airbus factory in Stevenage where the robot is being put together.\n        The six-wheeled vehicle will be equipped with instruments and a drill to search for evidence of past or present life on the Red Planet.\n        Giving the rover a name associated with a molecule fundamental to biology seems therefore to be wholly appropriate.\n        Rosalind Franklin played an integral role in the discovery of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid.\n        It was her X-ray images that allowed James Watson and Francis Crick to decipher its double-helix shape.\n        Franklin\'s early death from ovarian cancer in 1958, aged just 37, meant she never received the recognition given to her male peers.\n        The attachment to the European Space Agency (Esa) rover will now see her name travel beyond Earth.\n        "In the last year of Rosalind\'s life, I remember visiting her in hospital on the day when she was excited by the news of the [Soviet Sputnik satellite] - the very beginning of space exploration," Franklin\'s sister, Jenifer Glynn, said on Thursday.\n        "She could never have imagined that over 60 years later there would be a rover sent to Mars bearing her name, but somehow that makes this project even more special."'},{id:"newsMenuSports-1",title:"New Zealand v India: Rohit Sharma becomes record T20 run-scorer",description:"",link:"/news-menu/sports/newsMenuSports-1",img:"news-menu-sports-img-1",article:"Rohit Sharma became the highest run-scorer in Twenty20 internationals as India beat New Zealand to level the three-match series at 1-1.\n        The opener, 31, hit 50 off 29 balls as India chased 159 to win by seven wickets with seven balls to spare in Auckland.\n        He now has 2,288 runs, surpassing New Zealand's Martin Guptill's 2,272.\n        Rohit, who made his T20 debut for India against England in 2007, averages 32.68 from 92 matches.\n        He has scored four centuries and 16 fifties, with a strike-rate of 138.41.\n        Krunal Pandya took 3-28 to help restrict New Zealand to 158-8, which featured 50 from Colin de Grandhomme, his maiden T20 half-century.\n        Rohit, stand-in captain for the series as skipper Virat Kohli is being rested, shared an opening stand of 79 with Shikhar Dhawan in India's reply.\n        Although both fell in quick succession, Rishabh Pant made an unbeaten 40 off 28 balls and MS Dhoni 20 not out to seal a comfortable victory.\n        \"I'm very pleased with how we bowled and then we were quite clinical with the bat as well,\" said Rohit.\n        \"We were expecting a performance like that.
